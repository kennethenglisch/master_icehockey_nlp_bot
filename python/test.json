No more than twenty (20) Skaters and two (2) Goalkeepers shall be permitted. For the purposes of these playing rules, any reference to “Player” shall refer to both Skaters and Goalkeepers. Any reference to “Goalkeeper” shall mean that the section of the rule is specific to Goalkeepers. Prior to the start of each game, the Team Manager or Coach of each Team shall list on a “Line-up / Roster Sheet” the Players who are eligible to play in the game. For a Team to play a game, it must be able to put on the ice at least five (5) Skaters and one (1) Goalkeeper at the beginning of the game. Only eligible Players can be listed on the Roster Sheet and play in a Game. Players who are registered for a tournament or event but who are not listed on the Official Game Sheet can participate in the pre-game warm-up. The Coach must submit the “Line-up / Roster Sheet” to the Official Scorekeeper at least sixty (60) minutes prior to the start of the game. The Official Game Sheet with the listed names and numbers of all eligible Players must be handed to the On-ice Game Officials before the Game, and no change shall be permitted to the Official Game Sheet after the commencement of the Game. Prior to the Game, if an Official (on-ice or off-ice) notices that a Player is in uniform but has not been included on the Official Game Sheet, the Referee shall bring this to the attention of the offending Team so that the necessary correction can be made to the Official Game Sheet with no penalty assessed. At IIHF Championships, a representative from each Team must confirm the “Line-up / Roster Sheet” at least two (2) minutes prior to the start of the Game, and Players may be added or deleted up to the “opening face-off”. Game rules will not allow for a Team to have more than six (6) Players (one (1) Goalkeeper and five (5) Skaters) on the ice at any time during game action when the team is not penalized. {rule_reference_0} A Team must put at least four (4) Players (one (1) Goalkeeper and three (3) Skaters) on the ice, if two (2) or more Players are penalized. A Team must put the required number of players on the ice to resume play. {rule_reference_1} For more information refer to IIHF Sport Guideline and IIHF Event Codes.",
