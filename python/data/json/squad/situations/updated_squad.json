Commercial breaks shall be taken at the first stoppage of play after the following times on the game clock as it counts down: (I) Break number 1: 14.00 (min.) (II) Break number 2: 10.00 (min.) (III) Break number 3: 06.00 (min.) Despite the above indicated time slots, commercial breaks shall not be taken if: a) A goal is scored; b) A penalty shot is called; c) One of the Teams is playing short-handed; d) A fight breaks out on ice; e) An icing infraction is called; f) The net is dislodged accidentally by a defending player (incl. goalkeeper); and g) The puck is shot into the end zone from beyond the center red line and the goalkeeper freezes the puck resulting in a stoppage of play. Exceptions from point e-g above is when a penalty or penalties are assessed in the stoppage that affects the on-ice strength of either team. In the event that a commercial break is not taken during the time slot prescribed above, because of the exceptions above, the missed commercial opportunity shall be made up at the first stoppage of play in the next commercial break time slot. If there is another incident where the second commercial break is missed, this procedure shall continue to repeat itself until all commercial breaks are taken. However, there must always be at least 60 seconds between two commercial breaks. Any extra commercial break taken during a time slot shall follow the procedure described above and they shall be eliminated from the last remaining time slot of that period. They shall not be used to create extra commercial inventory for broadcasters. However, in such instances, the Commercial Coordinator will be instructed to turn on the light and signal the truck that an optional commercial opportunity is being taken. No commercial breaks shall be taken in the final thirty (30) seconds of the first and second periods, as well as during the final two (2) minutes of the third period. No commercial breaks shall be granted during overtime. The Teams shall comply with the following provisions during commercial breaks: a) Goalkeepers will be allowed to go to their respective players’ bench. b) Teams are allowed to change lines once the referee blows the whistle signaling the teams to return to the face-off with 20 seconds remaining in the commercial stoppage. c) These line changes will follow the same protocol as a normal line change during a stoppage of play.",

Any reference to “Goalkeeper” shall mean that the section of the rule is specific to Goalkeepers. Prior to the start of each game, the Team Manager or Coach of each Team shall list on a “Line-up / Roster Sheet” the Players who are eligible to play in the game. For a Team to play a game, it must be able to put on the ice at least five (5) Skaters and one (1) Goalkeeper at the beginning of the game. Only eligible Players can be listed on the Roster Sheet and play in a Game. Players who are registered for a tournament or event but who are not listed on the Official Game Sheet can participate in the pre-game warm-up. The Coach must submit the “Line-up / Roster Sheet” to the Official Scorekeeper at least sixty (60) minutes prior to the start of the game. The Official Game Sheet with the listed names and numbers of all eligible Players must be handed to the On-ice Game Officials before the Game, and no change shall be permitted to the Official Game Sheet after the commencement of the Game. Prior to the Game, if an Official (on-ice or off-ice) notices that a Player is in uniform but has not been included on the Official Game Sheet, the Referee shall bring this to the attention of the offending Team so that the necessary correction can be made to the Official Game Sheet with no penalty assessed. At IIHF Championships, a representative from each Team must confirm the “Line-up / Roster Sheet” at least two (2) minutes prior to the start of the Game, and Players may be added or deleted up to the “opening face-off”.

When this occurs, if it is deemed to be done deliberately, then the decision shall be NO GOAL. A goal cannot be scored when the puck has been deliberately batted with any part of the attacking Player’s body into the net (Rule 78.4 – Scoring a Goal) (II) When the puck has been kicked using a distinct kicking motion (Rule 49.2 – Kicking) (III) When the puck has deflected directly into the net off an official (Rule 85.4 – Puck Striking Official) (IV) When a goal has been scored and an ineligible Player is on the ice (Rule 68.5 – Disallowed Goal) (V) When an attacking Player has interfered with a Goalkeeper in their Goal Crease (Rule 69.1 – Interference on the Goalkeeper) (VI) When the puck has entered the net after making contact with an attacking Player’s stick that is above the height of the crossbar. Where the puck makes contact with the stick is the determining factor (Rule 80.3 – Disallowed Goal) (VII) When Video Review confirms the scoring of a goal at one end of the ice, any goal scored at the other end on the same play must be disallowed (Rule 37.2 – Video Review) (VIII) When a Linesperson reports a Double-minor Penalty for high-sticking or a Major Penalty to the Referee following the scoring of a goal by the offending Team, the goal must be disallowed, and the appropriate penalty assessed (Rule 32.4 – Reporting to Referee) (IX) When a Goalkeeper has been pushed into the net together with the puck after making a save (Rule 69.7 – Rebounds and Loose Pucks) (X) When the net becomes displaced accidentally. The goal frame is considered to be displaced if either or both goal pegs are no longer in their respective holes in the ice, or the net has come completely off one or both pegs, prior to or as the puck enters the goal. However, if this occurs as a result of the actions of a defending player, refer to (Rule 63.7 – Awarded Goal) (XI) During the delayed calling of a penalty, the offending Team cannot score unless the non-offending Team shoots the puck into their own net. This shall mean that a deflection off an offending Player or any physical action by an offending Player that may cause the puck to enter the non-offending Team’s goal, shall not be considered a legal goal. Play shall be stopped before the puck enters the net (whenever possible) and the signaled penalty assessed to the offending Team; (XII) When the Referee deems the play has been stopped, even if they have not physically had the opportunity to stop play by blowing their whistle; (XIII) Any goal scored, other than as covered by the official rules, shall not be allowed.",

Any reference to “Goalkeeper” shall mean that the section of the rule is specific to Goalkeepers. Prior to the start of each game, the Team Manager or Coach of each Team shall list on a “Line-up / Roster Sheet” the Players who are eligible to play in the game. For a Team to play a game, it must be able to put on the ice at least five (5) Skaters and one (1) Goalkeeper at the beginning of the game. Only eligible Players can be listed on the Roster Sheet and play in a Game. Players who are registered for a tournament or event but who are not listed on the Official Game Sheet can participate in the pre-game warm-up.

The Official Game Sheet with the listed names and numbers of all eligible Players must be handed to the On-ice Game Officials before the Game, and no change shall be permitted to the Official Game Sheet after the commencement of the Game. Prior to the Game, if an Official (on-ice or off-ice) notices that a Player is in uniform but has not been included on the Official Game Sheet, the Referee shall bring this to the attention of the offending Team so that the necessary correction can be made to the Official Game Sheet with no penalty assessed.

During the play, if an injured Player wishes to retire from the ice and be replaced by a substitute, they must do so at the Players’ Bench and not through any other exit leading from the Rink. This is not a legal Player change and therefore when a violation occurs, a Bench-minor Penalty shall be imposed. If a penalized Player has been injured, they may proceed to the Dressing Room without taking a seat in the Penalty Box. The penalized Team shall immediately put a substitute Player in the Penalty Box, who shall serve the penalty until the injured Player is able to return to the game. They would replace their Teammate in the Penalty Box at the next stoppage of play. For violation of this rule, a Bench Minor Penalty shall be imposed. Should the injured penalized Player who has been replaced in the Penalty Box return to their Players’ Bench prior to the expiration of their penalty, they shall not be eligible to play until their penalty has expired. This includes coincidental penalties when their substitute is still in the Penalty Box awaiting a stoppage in play. The injured Player must wait until their substitute has been released from the Penalty Box before they are eligible to play. If, however, there is a stoppage of play prior to the expiration of their penalty, they must then replace their Teammate in the Penalty Box and is then eligible to return once their penalty has expired. When a Player is injured so that they cannot continue play or go to their Players’ Bench, the play shall not be stopped until the injured Player’s Team has secured control of the puck. If the Player’s Team is in “control of the puck” at the time of injury, play shall be stopped immediately unless their Team is in a scoring position. In the case where it is obvious that a Player has sustained a serious injury, the Referee and/or Linesperson may stop the play immediately. Where an injury has occurred to a Player and there is a stoppage of play, a Team Doctor (or other Medical Personnel) may go onto the ice to attend to the injured Player without waiting for the Referee’s consent. When play has been stopped by the Referee or Linesperson due to an injured Player, or whenever an injured Player is attended to on the ice by the Coach or Medical Personnel, such Player must be substituted for immediately. This injured Player cannot return to the ice until play has resumed. When play is stopped for an injured Player, the ensuing “face-off” shall be conducted at the Face-off Spot in the zone nearest the location of the puck when the play was stopped. When the injured Player’s Team has control of the puck in the Attacking Zone, the “face-off” shall be conducted at the nearest Faceoff Spot in the Neutral Zone. When the injured Player is in their Defending Zone and the attacking Team is in “possession of the puck” in the Attacking Zone, the “face-off” shall be conducted at the nearest Face-off Spot in the defending Team’s zone. A player who lies on the ice either feigning an injury or refusing to get up off the ice will be issued a Minor Penalty.",

If no goal is scored in the Overtime period, then the IIHF Penalty Shot Shootout Procedure will apply. The following procedure will be utilized: (I) Shots will be taken at both ends of the ice surface. The fourteen (14) meter wide longitudinal center section of the Rink, between the Face-off Spots in the Neutral and End Zones, will be dryscraped by the ice-resurfacing machine prior to the Penalty Shot Shootout during the time required to organize the program accordingly. (II) The procedure will begin with five (5) different shooters from each Team taking alternate shots. The Skaters do not need to be named beforehand. Eligible to participate in the “Penalty Shot” Shootout will be all Players from both Teams listed on the Official Game Sheet except as specified in article 3 below. (III) Any Skater whose penalty had not been completed when the Overtime period ended is not eligible to be one of the Players selected to take the shots and must remain in the Penalty Box or in the Dressing Room. Also, Players serving penalties assessed during the “Penalty Shot” Shootout must remain in the Penalty Box or in the Dressing Room until the end of the procedure. (IV) The Referee will call the two Captains to the On-ice Officials’ Crease and flip a coin to determine which Team takes the first shot. The winner of the coin toss will have the choice whether their Team will shoot first or second. (V) The Goalkeepers shall defend the same goal as in the Overtime period and remain in the goal when their own team is taking a shot. (VI) The Goalkeepers from each Team may be changed after each shot. (VII) The shots will be taken in accordance with (Rule 24 – Penalty Shot) (VIII) The Players of both Teams will take the shots alternately until a decisive goal is scored. The remaining shots will not be taken. (IX) If the score is still tied after all shots are taken by each Team, the procedure shall continue with a “tiebreak shoot-out”, using the same or new Players. The Team that shot second in the first five Penalty Shot will start first in the “tie-break shots”. The game shall be finished as soon as a duel of two Players brings the decisive result. The same Player can be used for each shot by a Team in the “tie-break shoot-out”. (X) The Official Scorekeeper will record all shots taken, indicating the Players and goals scored. (XI) Only the decisive goal will count in the result of the game. It shall be credited to the Team that scored the goal and charged against the Team that was scored upon. (XII) If a Team declines to participate in the “Penalty Shot” Shootout, the game will be declared as a loss for that Team and the other Team will be awarded 3 points for a win. If a Player declines to take a shot it will be declared \"no score\" for their Team.If a Goalkeeper sustains an injury or becomes ill, they must be ready to resume play immediately or be replaced by a substitute Goalkeeper and no additional time shall be allowed for the purpose of enabling the injured or ill Goalkeeper to resume their position. No warm-up shall be permitted for a substitute Goalkeeper in any game. The substitute Goalkeeper shall be subject to the regular rules governing Goalkeepers and shall be entitled to the same privileges. When a substitution for the injured Goalkeeper has been made, the injured Goalkeeper is not allowed to resume the position until the next stoppage of play. For a violation of the rule, a Minor Penalty for “Delay of Game” shall be assessed.

At the discretion of the On-ice Officials, should a substituting Player come onto the ice before their Teammate is within the 1.50 m limit of the Players’ Bench (and therefore clearly causing their Team to have “too many Players” on the ice), then a Bench Minor Penalty may be assessed. When a Player is retiring from the ice surface and is within the 1.50 m limit of their Players’ Bench, and their substitute is on the ice, then the retiring Player shall be considered off the ice for the purpose of Rule 70 – Leaving Players Bench or Penalty Box. If in the course of making a substitution, either the Player entering the game or the Player retiring from the ice surface plays the puck with their stick, skates or hands or who checks or makes any physical contact with an opposing Player while either the Player entering the game or the retiring Player is actually on the ice, then the infraction of “too many Players on the ice” will be called. If in the course of a substitution either the Player(s) entering the play or the Player(s) retiring is struck by the puck accidentally, the play will not be stopped, and no penalty will be called. During the play, the Player retiring from the ice must do so at the Players’ Bench and not through any other exit leading from the Rink. This is not a legal Player change and therefore when a violation occurs, a Bench Minor Penalty shall be imposed. A Player coming onto the ice as a substitute Player is considered on the ice once both of their skates are on the ice. If they play the puck or interfere with an opponent while still on the Players’ Bench, they shall be penalized under (Rule 56 – Interference) A retiring Player (coming off the ice) who has one skate on the ice and one skate off the ice in the Players’ Bench is considered as “off the ice”.If a Goalkeeper sustains an injury or becomes ill, they must be ready to resume play immediately or be replaced by a substitute Goalkeeper and no additional time shall be allowed for the purpose of enabling the injured or ill Goalkeeper to resume their position. No warm-up shall be permitted for a substitute Goalkeeper in any game. The substitute Goalkeeper shall be subject to the regular rules governing Goalkeepers and shall be entitled to the same privileges. When a substitution for the injured Goalkeeper has been made, the injured Goalkeeper is not allowed to resume the position until the next stoppage of play. For a violation of the rule, a Minor Penalty for “Delay of Game” shall be assessed. When play has been stopped by the Referee or Linesperson due to an injured Goalkeeper, such Goalkeeper must be substituted for only if they have to proceed to the Players’ Bench to receive medical attention. Where an injury has occurred to a Goalkeeper and there is a stoppage of play, a Team Doctor (or other Medical Personnel) may go onto the ice to attend to the injured Player without waiting for the Referee’s consent. If the Doctor or Medical Personnel has come onto the ice to attend to the Goalkeeper and there is no undue delay, the Goalkeeper may remain in the game. However, no additional time shall be permitted by the Referee for the purpose of enabling the injured Goalkeeper to resume their position (i.e., no warm-up).The Referee shall announce the reason for the assessed “Penalty Shot” and shall have the Skater selected by the Team entitled to take the “Penalty Shot” announced over the Public Address System. The puck shall then be placed on the Center Face-off Spot and the Player taking the “Penalty Shot” will, on the instruction of the Referee, by blowing their whistle, play the puck from there and shall attempt to score on the Goalkeeper. The puck must be kept in motion towards the opponent’s Goal Line and once it is shot, the play shall be considered complete. No goal can be scored on a rebound of any kind (an exception being the puck off the Goal Post or crossbar, then the Goalkeeper and then directly into the goal), and any time the puck crosses the Goal Line or comes to a complete stop, the “Penalty Shot” shall be considered complete. The “lacrosse-like move” whereby the puck is picked up on the blade of the stick and “whipped” into the net shall be permitted provided the puck is not raised above the height of the shoulders at any time and when released, is not carried higher than the crossbar. (Rule 80.1 – High-sticking the Puck) The “spin-o-rama type move” where the Player completes a 360° turn as they approach the goal, shall not be permitted. Should a Player perform such a move during the “Penalty Shot”, the shot shall be stopped by the Referee and no goal will be the result. Only a Player designated as a Goalkeeper or alternate Goalkeeper may defend against a “Penalty Shot”. The Goalkeeper must remain in their crease until the Player taking a “Penalty Shot” has touched the puck. If at the time a “Penalty Shot” is awarded, the Goalkeeper of the penalized Team has been removed from the ice to substitute another Player, the Goalkeeper shall be permitted to return to the ice before the “Penalty Shot” is taken. The Team against whom the “Penalty Shot” has been assessed may replace their Goalkeeper to defend against the shot, however, the substitute goalkeeper is required to remain in the game until the next stoppage of play. While the “Penalty Shot” is being taken, Players of both sides shall withdraw to the sides of the Rink and in front of their own Player’s Bench.Once the Goalkeeper has been removed for an extra Attacker in Overtime during the game, they must wait for the next stoppage of play before returning to their position. Any attempt by the Goalkeeper to return to his position prior to the next stoppage of play (“on the fly”) shall be deemed to be an “illegal substitution” and a Bench Minor penalty shall be assessed for having an ineligible Player would apply.Following the stoppage of play, the visiting Team shall promptly place a line-up on the ice ready for play and no substitution shall be made from that time until play has been resumed. The Home Team may then make any desired substitution, except in cases following an “icing”, which does not result in the delay of the game. “Placing a line-up on the ice” shall mean that both Teams shall place the full complement of Players (and not exceed) to which they are entitled within the line change time frame. If there is any undue delay by either Team in changing Players, the Referee shall order the offending Team or Teams to take their positions immediately and not permit any further Player changes. When a substitution has been made under the above rule, no additional substitution may be made until play commences. Once the line change procedure has been completed, no additional Player substitutions shall be permitted until the “face-off” has been completed legally and play has resumed, except when a penalty or penalties are imposed that affect the “on-ice strength” of either or both Teams. This may include penalties imposed following the completion of the line change and prior to the “face-off”, or due to a penalty assessed for a “face-off” violation – refer to Rule 82.2 – Line Change – Procedure. A Team that is in violation of (Rule 63.8 – Delaying the Game) or (Rule 81 – Icing) shall not be permitted to make any Player substitutions prior to the ensuing “face-off”. However, a Team shall be permitted to make a Player substitution to replace a Goalkeeper who had been substituted for an extra attacker, to replace an injured Player, or when a penalty has been assessed which affects the “on-ice strength” of either Team. The determination of Players on ice will be made when the puck leaves the offending Player’s stick. Goalkeepers’ substitution during a game will be conducted within the same time frame as a regular line change. No extra time will be allotted to the Goalkeeper coming off the bench, except in the case where an injury to a Goalkeeper occurs.",

                    "context": "All Players of each Team shall be dressed uniformly with an approved design and color of their helmets, jerseys, short pants, and socks. All jerseys of a Team must be of the same design, including logo on the front, numbers on the sleeves and back, and nameplate on the back. The dominant color of the uniform must cover approximately 80 % of the jersey and socks, excluding names and numbers. If, in the opinion of the Referee, the uniform colors of the competing Teams are too similar and there is a possibility of misidentifying Players, it is the responsibility of the Home Team to change its jerseys. All Players on a Team must wear the same uniforms and jersey numbers in the on-ice warm-up as during the game. Altered uniforms of any kind, i.e. Velcro inserts, over-sized jerseys, altered collars, etc., will not be permitted. Any Player not complying with this rule shall not be permitted to participate in the game – refer to Rule 9.5. – Protective Equipment. Players are not allowed to change or exchange jersey numbers once the game has started. They must wear the same number for the game’s entirety and throughout entire competition. As an exception to this rule, when a Player’s jersey becomes stained with blood or becomes badly torn during a game, they may be required by an On-ice Official to leave the ice and change into a designated jersey with another number and without a nameplate. Each Team shall design and wear distinctive and contrasting uniforms for their home and away games, no parts of which shall be interchangeable except the pants. Any concerns regarding a Player’s uniform (including the Goalkeeper) shall be reported by the Referee to the Proper Authorities. All Player pants must be worn in a uniform fashion by all Players. The pants must be one consistent color around and throughout the leg of the pant. Pant legs are not to be ripped, cut, or torn in the leg / thigh area. Graffiti-type designs, patterns, artwork, drawings, or slogans which are abusive or obscene and refer to culture, race, or religion are not allowed on any part of the uniform. ( » For more information refer to IIHF Event Codes.)Equipment must conform to safety standards and be used only to protect Players, not to enhance or improve playing ability or to cause injury to an opponent. All players are strongly recommended to wear cut-resistant socks, sleeves, or undergarments. All protective equipment, except gloves, headgear, mouthguards, neck laceration protector and Goalkeepers’ leg guards must be worn under the uniform. The complete protective equipment must be worn during the game and during “pre-game warm-up”. Should it be brought to the attention of the Referee that a Player is wearing, for example, an elbow pad that is not covered by their jersey, they shall instruct the Player to cover up the pad. A second violation by the same Player would result in a Minor Penalty being assessed. Whenever it is deemed by the Referee that a Player is wearing any equipment that does not meet with the IIHF regulations, they shall instruct the Player to change or remove the piece of equipment. The corresponding Player and their Team will be warned by the Referee to adjust the equipment accordingly. After the warning, all Players on that Team wearing such equipment shall be penalized in accordance with Rule 12 – Illegal Equipment. If the Player refuses, they shall be assessed a Minor Penalty for “Delay of Game” and if they return to the ice without making the change, they shall be issued a Misconduct Penalty. Should this happen a third time, the Player shall be issued a Game Misconduct Penalty.",

All jerseys of a Team must be of the same design, including logo on the front, numbers on the sleeves and back, and nameplate on the back. The dominant color of the uniform must cover approximately 80 % of the jersey and socks, excluding names and numbers. If, in the opinion of the Referee, the uniform colors of the competing Teams are too similar and there is a possibility of misidentifying Players, it is the responsibility of the Home Team to change its jerseys. All Players on a Team must wear the same uniforms and jersey numbers in the on-ice warm-up as during the game. Altered uniforms of any kind, i.e. Velcro inserts, over-sized jerseys, altered collars, etc., will not be permitted. Any Player not complying with this rule shall not be permitted to participate in the game – refer to Rule 9.5. – Protective Equipment. Players are not allowed to change or exchange jersey numbers once the game has started. They must wear the same number for the game’s entirety and throughout entire competition. As an exception to this rule, when a Player’s jersey becomes stained with blood or becomes badly torn during a game, they may be required by an On-ice Official to leave the ice and change into a designated jersey with another number and without a nameplate. Each Team shall design and wear distinctive and contrasting uniforms for their home and away games, no parts of which shall be interchangeable except the pants. Any concerns regarding a Player’s uniform (including the Goalkeeper) shall be reported by the Referee to the Proper Authorities. All Player pants must be worn in a uniform fashion by all Players. The pants must be one consistent color around and throughout the leg of the pant. Pant legs are not to be ripped, cut, or torn in the leg / thigh area. Graffiti-type designs, patterns, artwork, drawings, or slogans which are abusive or obscene and refer to culture, race, or religion are not allowed on any part of the uniform. ( » For more information refer to IIHF Event Codes.) Each Player listed in the line-up of each Team shall wear an individual identifying number that is 25 – 30 cm high on the back of the jersey and 10 cm high on both sleeves. Numbers are limited to whole numbers from 1 to 99. Jersey numbers such as 00, ½ (fractions), .5 (decimals), 101 (three digit) are not permitted. In addition, each Player shall wear their surname in full, in block letters 10 cm high, across the back of their jersey at shoulder height, in block capital Roman letters of a font approved by the IIHF prior to the game or competition. A Player whose hair is long enough to obscure the nameplate or number on the back of the jersey must fashion it in a ponytail or tuck the hair under the helmet. Players who do not comply with these rules are not allowed to participate in the game. Goalkeeper's Jerseyrefer to Rule 9.4. Jerseys must not extend lengthwise past the end of the pants, and the sleeves must not extend past the fingers of the glove. No inserts or additions are to be added to the standard Players’ jersey as produced by the manufacturer. Modifications at the manufacturer are not allowed unless approved in advance by the IIHF. Jerseys must be worn completely outside of the pants and must be properly fastened to the pants at all times with tie-down straps. If any Player on that Team fails to comply after a warning, a Minor Penalty will be assessed. (Rule 63 – Delaying the Game) Goalkeepers who do not comply with these rules are not allowed to participate in the game. Jerseys are not to be excessively oversized. No inserts or additions are to be added to the standard Goalkeeper’s jersey as produced by the manufacturer. Modifications at the manufacturer are not allowed unless approved in advance by the IIHF. No “tying down” of the jersey is allowed at the wrists if it creates a tension across the jersey allowing for a “webbing effect” which is not permitted. No other tie downs are allowed that create a “webbing effect”. The length of a jersey is illegal if it covers any area between the Goalkeeper’s legs. Equipment must conform to safety standards and be used only to protect Players, not to enhance or improve playing ability or to cause injury to an opponent. All players are strongly recommended to wear cut-resistant socks, sleeves, or undergarments. All protective equipment, except gloves, headgear, mouthguards, neck laceration protector and Goalkeepers’ leg guards must be worn under the uniform. The complete protective equipment must be worn during the game and during “pre-game warm-up”. Should it be brought to the attention of the Referee that a Player is wearing, for example, an elbow pad that is not covered by their jersey, they shall instruct the Player to cover up the pad. A second violation by the same Player would result in a Minor Penalty being assessed. Whenever it is deemed by the Referee that a Player is wearing any equipment that does not meet with the IIHF regulations, they shall instruct the Player to change or remove the piece of equipment. The corresponding Player and their Team will be warned by the Referee to adjust the equipment accordingly. After the warning, all Players on that Team wearing such equipment shall be penalized in accordance with Rule 12 – Illegal Equipment. If the Player refuses, they shall be assessed a Minor Penalty for “Delay of Game” and if they return to the ice without making the change, they shall be issued a Misconduct Penalty. Should this happen a third time, the Player shall be issued a Game Misconduct Penalty. All Players shall wear a helmet of design, material and construction approved for ice hockey, with a chin strap always properly fastened, including during “pre-game warm-up”, participating in the game, either on the playing surface or the Players’ Benches or Penalty Boxes.

Should they do so, the play shall be stopped once their Team has gained control of the puck and a Minor Penalty shall be assessed to the offending Player. If a Player’s chin strap becomes unfastened during game action, but the helmet stays on their head, they may continue to play until the next stoppage or until they leave the ice. A Player who intentionally removes an opponent’s helmet during play shall be assessed a Minor Penalty for “Roughing”. (Rule 51 – Roughing) When a goalkeeper is hit on the face mask by a hard shot with the puck and the Referee believes the Goalkeeper is or may be dazed by that hard shot, the Referee may stop play for safety reasons, if there is no immediate scoring chance for the attacking Team.

There are three (3) permissible types of facial protection which can be attached to the front of a Skaters' helmet: a visor protection, a cage protection, or a full-face protection visor. All Players born after December 31, 1974, must wear, as a minimum a visor as a facial protection. The visor face protection must be properly affixed to their helmet, and must extend down in such a fashion as to ensure adequate eye protection, to cover the eyes and nose in its entirety. It must be fixed to the helmet along the sides so that it cannot be flipped up. A Player whose visor face protection becomes cracked or broken during game action must leave the ice immediately. Players are not allowed to wear a colored or tinted visor that would make it impossible to make eye contact with the player. Participating Teams in an IIHF Competition must ensure that their Players are equipped with a helmet manufactured and approved specifically for ice hockey and that, as applicable, a visor or a full-face protection is properly attached to it. Specific rules and guidelines for appropriate head / face / mouth protection for Women's Hockey and Men's Junior “Under 20” and “Under 18” categories. (Rule 102 – Women’s Hockey Specific Equipment) and (Rule 202 – Men’s Junior Hockey Specific Equipment) Equipment that does not conform to IIHF standards and equipment that is deemed unacceptable for the game action will be classified as “Dangerous Equipment”. A Player using “Dangerous Equipment” will be sent off the ice by the Referee and their Team shall receive a warning from the Referee. After the Team has been warned, all Players on that Team wearing such equipment shall be penalized. (Rule 12 – Illegal Equipment) Dangerous Equipment includes wearing a visor in a way that may cause injury to an opponent, wearing non-approved equipment, using dangerous or illegal skates or stick, failing to wear equipment under the uniform (except gloves, helmet, and goalkeeper’s pads), and cutting the palm out of one or both gloves. The use of pads or protectors made of metal, or of any other material likely to cause injury to an opposing Player is prohibited. Referees have the authority to prohibit any equipment they feel may cause injury to any participant in the game. Failure to comply with the Referees’ instructions shall result in a Minor Penalty for “Delay of Game”. A mask or protector of a design approved by the IIHF may be worn by a Player who has sustained a facial injury. In the first instance, the injured Player shall be entitled to wear any protective device prescribed by the Team Doctor. If any opposing Team objects to the device, it may record its objection with the IIHF. In cases where a stick may have been modified and it is evident that the edges have not been beveled, the Referee shall deem the stick to be dangerous equipment and removed from the game until the edges can be beveled sufficiently. No penalty is to be assessed unless the Player returns to the ice with the unmodified stick, in which case they will be assessed a Minor Penalty. (Rule 63 – Delaying the Game) Skaters’ shin pads must be of a size that allows them to fit inside standard Skaters’ socks. No protrusions from or additions to the manufactured shin pads are allowed. Skates must consist of only four parts: boot, blade, blade holder, and laces. The boot must conform to the foot of the Skater and not be unduly wide or long or have any attachments to it. The blade must be smooth from front to back and secured in the blade holder at all times. It cannot have a pick in the manner of figure skates. The front and back of the blade must be properly covered by the blade holder such that no part of either end protrudes. The blade must not extend in front of the toe or behind the heel of the boot in the manner of speed skates. No mechanical attachment or any other device which might help a Skater’s speed or ability to skate is allowed. Laces may be of any non-fluorescent color and tied in any manner, but they must not be so long that they touch the ice. A Goalkeeper’s skates must have a non-fluorescent protective cowling at the front of each boot. The skate blade must be flat and cannot be longer than the boot. Any blades, projections, or “cheaters” added to the boot in order to give the Goalkeeper additional contact to the ice surface are not allowed. For all players in all categories of IIHF Competition, it is mandatory to wear a neck laceration protector designed for this specific purpose, choosing a design that covers as much of the neck as possible. The Neck Laceration Protector must be properly worn and must not be modified or alternated in any way. For violation of this rule, after warning by the Referee, a Minor Penalty shall be imposed. (Rule 12 – Illegal Equipment) For violation of this rule in Junior Hockey (Rule 102.7 – Women’s Hockey Specific Equipment) and (Rule 202.7 – Men’s Junior Hockey Specific Equipment) A Goalkeeper may attach a throat protector to the chin of their facemask. It must be made of a material that will not cause injury. The IIHF recommends that all Players wear a mouthguard, preferably of the custom-made variety. The mouthguard is designed to protect the teeth and jaws from impact and may also serve to reduce the risk of concussions. It is strongly recommended that Players use a custom-made mouthguard. It is recommended to wear this mouthguard in a compliant manner at all times when on the ice. Players who play in senior categories but are of the age as “Under 20” and “Under 18” categories must wear the appropriate protective equipment of these U20 and U18 categories in accordance with the specific rules. Specific rules and guidelines for appropriate head / face / neck / throat / mouth protection for Women's Hockey and Men's Junior “Under 20” and “Under 18” categories. (Rule 102 – Women’s Hockey Specific Equipment) and (Rule 202 – Men’s Junior Hockey Specific Equipment) All protective equipment, except gloves, headgear, mouthguards, neck laceration protection and Goalkeepers’ leg guards must be worn under the uniform. For violation of this rule, after warning by the Referee, a Minor Penalty shall be imposed. Players violating this rule shall not be permitted to participate in the game until such equipment has been corrected or removed. If the Player refuses, they shall be assessed a Minor Penalty for “Illegal Equipment” and if they return to the ice without making the change, they shall be issued a Misconduct Penalty. Should this happen a third time, the Player shall be issued a Game Misconduct Penalty. A glove from which all or part of the palm has been removed or cut to permit the use of the bare hand shall be considered illegal equipment and if any Player wears such a glove in play, a Minor Penalty shall be imposed on them. When a complaint is made under this rule, and such complaint is not sustained, a Bench-minor Penalty shall be imposed against the complaining Team for delaying the game. All elbow pads which do not have a soft protective outer covering of sponge rubber or similar material at least 1.5 cm thick shall be considered dangerous equipment. These equipment regulations (Section 3) are written in the spirit of “Fair Play”. If at any time the IIHF feels that this spirit is being abused, the offending equipment will be deemed ineligible for play until a hearing has ruled on its eligibility. Inspections by the IIHF can take place at any time, before, during, or after any game. IIHF representatives may obtain equipment from any Players of the participating Teams. Complained and illegal equipment must be corrected before participation in a game. If further irregularities are found during follow-up checks, the incident will be reported to the Proper Authorities. Refusal to submit the equipment for IIHF measurement will result in the same sanctions as those imposed on a Player with illegal equipment.",

A Player will be penalized if they throw, toss, slide or shoot a stick to a Teammate (Skater) on the ice, or if they pick up and play with an opponent’s stick. A Player may not participate in the play using a Goalkeeper’s stick. A Minor Penalty shall be imposed for an infraction of this rule. A Player using a stick thrown on the ice from the Players’ Bench or Penalty Box will not receive a penalty. However, the offending Team responsible for throwing the stick will receive a Bench Minor Penalty.A Goalkeeper may continue to play with a “broken stick” until a stoppage of play or until they have one legally handed to them by a Teammate. A replacement stick for a “broken stick” cannot be thrown to a Goalkeeper on the ice surface. The stick must be passed from hand to hand to the Goalkeeper by a Teammate on the ice. For a violation of this rule, the offending Player shall receive a Minor Penalty for “throwing the stick”. (Rule 53 – Throwing Equipment) An abandoned, intact stick accidentally dropped by the Goalkeeper may be passed from hand to hand to the Goalkeeper, or moved, pushed, or slid toward the Goalkeeper by a Teammate near the Goalkeeper on the ice as long as the moved stick does not interfere with play or cause a distraction to the game or opposing Players. If a Player causes interference with play or distraction to an opposing Player by moving a lost stick, a Minor Penalty or “Penalty Shot” shall be imposed. (Rule 53 – Throwing Equipment) The Goalkeeper shall not receive a penalty for receiving the stick. A Goalkeeper whose stick is “broken or illegal” may not go to the Players’ Bench for a replacement but must receive their stick from a Teammate as described above. A Goalkeeper may participate in the play using a Skater’s stick until such time as they are legally provided with a replacement Goalkeeper’s stick. For an infraction of this rule, a Minor Penalty shall be imposed on the Goalkeeper.A Minor Penalty shall be imposed: (I) For throwing a stick on any Player on the Ice, who throws their stick or any part thereof or any other object in the direction of the puck or an opponent in any zone, except when such act has been penalized by the assessment of a “Penalty Shot” (Rule 53.7) or the Awarding of a Goal (Rule 53.8) ; (II) For throwing a stick when a defending Player shoots or throws a stick or any other object in the Defending Zone but not at the puck or puck carrier; (III) For “interference” when a Player moves a stick that is not broken and it interferes with an opposing Player (except where a “Penalty Shot” Rule 53.7 , or the Awarding of a Goal Rule 53.8 applies) or when the Player who lost said stick is prevented from retrieving it as a result; No penalty will be assessed if moving the non-broken stick if it does not interfere with the play or the opposing Player is not attempting to retrieve it. When a Player discards the broken portion of a stick or some other object by tossing it or shooting it to the side of the ice (and not over the Boards) in such a way as to not interfere with the play or opposing Player(s), no penalty will be imposed for so doing. (IV) For “Unsportsmanlike Conduct”, when a Player throws their stick or any part thereof or any other object or piece of equipment outside the Playing Area in protest of an Official’s decision. For an additional Game Misconduct Penalty see Rule 53.5 – Game Misconduct Penalty .The Referee, at their discretion, may assess a Major Penalty and an automatic Game Misconduct Penalty if a Player’s action of “throwing a stick or any other object” or piece of equipment at an opposing Player, Coach or team personnel could result in injury to the opponent. Note: Such assessment of reckless endangerment shall be based on the severity of the infraction and the general reprehensibility involved.",

Should this happen a third time, the Player shall be issued a Game Misconduct Penalty.Equipment that does not conform to IIHF standards and equipment that is deemed unacceptable for the game action will be classified as “Dangerous Equipment”. A Player using “Dangerous Equipment” will be sent off the ice by the Referee and their Team shall receive a warning from the Referee. After the Team has been warned, all Players on that Team wearing such equipment shall be penalized. (Rule 12 – Illegal Equipment) Dangerous Equipment includes wearing a visor in a way that may cause injury to an opponent, wearing non-approved equipment, using dangerous or illegal skates or stick, failing to wear equipment under the uniform (except gloves, helmet, and goalkeeper’s pads), and cutting the palm out of one or both gloves. The use of pads or protectors made of metal, or of any other material likely to cause injury to an opposing Player is prohibited. Referees have the authority to prohibit any equipment they feel may cause injury to any participant in the game. Failure to comply with the Referees’ instructions shall result in a Minor Penalty for “Delay of Game”. A mask or protector of a design approved by the IIHF may be worn by a Player who has sustained a facial injury. In the first instance, the injured Player shall be entitled to wear any protective device prescribed by the Team Doctor. If any opposing Team objects to the device, it may record its objection with the IIHF. In cases where a stick may have been modified and it is evident that the edges have not been beveled, the Referee shall deem the stick to be dangerous equipment and removed from the game until the edges can be beveled sufficiently. No penalty is to be assessed unless the Player returns to the ice with the unmodified stick, in which case they will be assessed a Minor Penalty. (Rule 63 – Delaying the Game) All Players participating in the \"Under 20\" age category must wear facial protection as described under rule 9.6 and 9.7 (Rule 9.6 – Helmets) (Rule 9.7 – Facial Protection) Players without the mentioned protection are not allowed to participate in a game. Younger Players in the “Under 18” age category who participate in the “Under 20” age category must wear the protective equipment as specified and described for the “Under 18” age category. All Players participating in the \"Under 18\" age category must wear a full-face protection (full-visor or cage), properly fixed to the helmet. It must be fixed to the helmet along the sides such that it cannot be flipped up. (Rule 9.6 – Helmets) (Rule 9.7 – Facial Protection) A Player whose full-face protection becomes cracked or broken during game action must leave the ice immediately. All Goalkeepers in this “Under 18” age category must wear a facemask constructed in such a way that neither a puck nor a stick blade can penetrate the openings. Players without the mentioned protection are not allowed to participate in a game. All Players in the “Under 20” age category must wear a mouthguard, preferably of the custom-made variety, if they are not wearing a full-face protection (full-visor or cage). (Rule 9.13 – Mouthguard) The mouthguard is designed to protect the teeth and jaws from impact and may also serve to reduce the risk of concussions. Players must wear this mouthguard in a compliant manner at all times when on the ice. It is not allowed to wear the mouthguard not completely in the mouth (e.g. to chew on it). Younger Players in the “Under 18” age category who participate in the “Under 20” age category must wear the protective equipment as specified and described for the “Under 18” age category – refer to Rule 202.4 – Junior Hockey – Specific Equipment Rules. Players without the mentioned protection are not allowed to participate in a game. It is strongly recommended that all Players in the \"Under 18\" age category wear a mouthguard, preferably custom-made. There is no obligation to wear as they wear a full-face protection (full visor or cage). (Rule 9.13 – Mouthguard) The mouthguard is designed to protect the teeth and jaws from impact and may also serve to reduce the risk of concussions. It is recommended to wear this mouthguard in a compliant manner at all times when on the ice. Players must wear the ear-protection, attached to their helmets. Players must wear the ear-protection, attached to their helmets. The On-ice officials will respond appropriately if a player on the ice is not wearing their protection equipment in accordance with the rules (e.g., visor pushed up, face protection not properly attached, removed ear-protection, etc.). The On-ice officials will respond appropriately when a Player who is required to wear a mouthguard is obviously not wearing it while on the ice. The Game Officials will then take the offending Player to the appropriate Player’s Bench and issue a warning to the Team through the Coach. The Game Officials shall also inform the other Team and warn them as well. Both teams are now warned that Players requested to wear the protection equipment properly. The next Player found not to be wearing the protection equipment not in accordance with the rule shall be penalized with a ten minute (10’) Misconduct Penalty.",

Note: When such conduct is directed at any one other than an official, (Rule 75 – Unsportsmanlike Conduct) shall be applied.A Minor Penalty for “Delay of Game” shall be assessed: (I) On any Player, including the Goalkeeper, who holds, “freezes” or plays the puck with their stick, skates or body in such a manner as to deliberately cause a stoppage of play. Regarding to a Goalkeeper, this rule applies outside of their Goal Crease area; (II) On any Player who deliberately shoots or bats (using their hand or stick) the puck outside the playing area (from anywhere on the ice surface) during the play or after a stoppage of play; (III) On any Player who shoots or bats (using their hand or stick) the puck directly (non-deflected) out of the playing surface from their Defending Zone, except where there is no Protective Glass. The determining factor shall be the position of the puck when it was shot or batted by the offending Player. If contact with the puck occurs while the puck is inside the Defending Zone, and subsequently goes out of play, the Minor Penalty shall be assessed. When the puck is shot over the Protective Glass surrounding the Players’ Bench, the penalty will be assessed. Note: When the puck is shot into the Players’ Bench, the penalty will not apply.

The Referee shall stop play immediately when the offending Team gains “control” of the puck. Note: If a Player deliberately displaces a Goal Post from its normal position when an opponent has an imminent scoring opportunity on an open net, a goal may be awarded by the Referee (Rule 63.7 – Awarded Goal) (V) On a Player other than the Goalkeeper who deliberately falls on or gathers the puck into their body; Note: Any Player who drops to their knees to block a shot should not be penalized if the puck is shot under them or becomes lodged in their clothing or equipment but any use of the hands to make the puck unplayable should be penalized promptly; (VI) On a Goalkeeper who “races out” of their Goal Crease in an attempt to beat the attacking Player to the puck and instead of playing the puck jumps on the puck causing a stoppage of play; Note: If a Goalkeeper comes out of their Goal Crease to “cut down the angle” on a shot and after making the save covers the puck, this shall be legal. (VII) On a Goalkeeper who, when they are in their own Goal Crease, deliberately falls on or gathers the puck into their body or who holds or places the puck against any part of the goal in such a manner as to cause a stoppage of play unless they are actually being checked by an opponent; (VIII) On a Goalkeeper who plays the puck outside of the Designated Area behind the net. The determining factor shall be the position of the puck. Note: The Minor Penalty will not be assessed when a Goalkeeper plays the puck while maintaining skate contact with the Goal Crease. (IX) For adjustments to clothing, equipment, skates, or sticks. Note: No penalty should be assessed when a water bottle is delivered to a Goalkeeper, however, this should be conducted during time-outs and if, in the opinion of the Referee, it is being done to intentionally delay the game, a Minor Penalty may be assessed. (X) No delay shall be permitted for the repair or adjustment of Goalkeeper’s equipment. If adjustments are required, the Goalkeeper shall leave the ice and their place shall be taken by the substitute Goalkeeper immediately.

For every “Delayed Off-side” situation, including an “intentional off-side”, the Linesperson will raise their non-whistle arm. They will allow play to continue and, if a stoppage of play occurs, there will be four possible “face-off” locations: (I) If carried over the Blue Line – “face-off” outside the Blue Line. (II) If shot into the Attacking Zone (or errant pass) – nearest Face-off Spot in the zone from which the pass or shot originated that gives the offending Team the least amount of “territorial advantage” (even if deflected off an attacking or defending Player or an official). (III) If the defending Player is pressured or about to be checked by an attacking Player – nearest Face-off Spot in the zone from which the pass or shot originated that gives the offending Team the least amount of “territorial advantage” (even if deflected off an attacking or defending Player or an official). (IV) If deemed to be an “intentional off-side” – Face-off Spot in the offending Team’s End Zone. When the Linesperson signals a “Delayed Off-side” and a defending Player shoots the puck which goes over the Protection Glass and out of play, the ensuing “face-off” shall be conducted at one of the Defending Zone End Zone Face-off Spots and the defending Player would be assessed a Minor Penalty. (Rule 63 – Delaying the Game) When the Linesperson signals a “Delayed Off-side” and the original shot deflects off a defending Player and out of play, the ensuing “face-off” shall take place at the nearest Face-off Spot in the zone from where the puck was shot. When the defending Team is about to be penalized in the Defending Zone and the Linesperson has a “Delayed Off-side” signaled against the attacking Team on the same play, the ensuing “face-off” shall be conducted at one of the Defending Zone End Zone Face-off Spots.",

When the Minor Penalties of two Players of the same Team terminate at the same time, the Captain of that Team shall designate to the Referee which of such Players will return to the ice first and the Referee will instruct the Penalty Timekeeper accordingly. It is the responsibility of the Referees to award goals and report the ”goal scorer” and “assists”, and their decision in this respect is final, notwithstanding the report of the Referee or any other Game Official. The Officials Scorekeeper, with the assistance of the Statistic staff will confirm the “goal scorer” and any Player deserving an “assist”. This decision is final in this regard and no changes can be made after the conclusion of the game. The use of video replay to verify the proper awarding of a goal or an assist is essential. Such awards shall be made or withheld strictly in accordance with the provisions of this rule. Therefore, it is essential that the Official Scorekeeper be thoroughly familiar with every aspect of this rule; be alerted to observe all actions which could affect the awarding of a goal or assist; and, above all, give or withhold awards with absolute impartiality. In case of an obvious error in awarding a goal or an assist that has been announced, it should be corrected promptly, but changes should not be made in the official scoring summary after the Referee has signed the game report. The Team scoring the greatest number of goals during the three (3) twenty-minute periods shall be the winner and shall be credited with three (3) points in the standings. In the event a winner during the Round Robin or Preliminary Round is determined in the Overtime period or the shootout, the winning Team shall be credited with two (2) points in the standings and the losing Team will be credited with one (1) point in the standings. A “goal” shall be credited in the scoring records to a Player who shall have propelled the puck into the opponent’s goal. Each “goal” shall count one point in the Player’s record. Only one point can be credited to any one Player on a goal. When a Player scores a goal, an “assist” shall be credited to the Player or Players (maximum two) who touch the puck prior to the “goal scorer” provided no defender plays or has “control of the puck” subsequently. Each “assist” shall count one point in the Player’s record. Only one point can be credited to any one Player on a goal. A goal shall be scored when the puck shall have been put between the Goal Posts by the stick of a Player of the attacking side, from in front and below the crossbar, and entirely across a red line the width of the diameter of the Goal Posts drawn on the ice from one Goal Post to the other with the goal frame in its proper position. The goal frame shall be considered in its proper position when at least a portion of the flexible peg(s) are still inside both the Goal post and the hole in the ice. The flexible pegs could be bent, but as long as at least a portion of the flexible peg(s) are still in the hole in the ice and the Goal Post, the goal frame shall be deemed to be in its proper position. The goal frame could be raised somewhat on one post (or both), but as long as the flexible pegs are still in contact with the holes in the ice and the Goal Posts, the goal frame shall not be deemed to be displaced. A goal shall be scored if the puck is shot into the goal by a Player of the defending side. The Player of the attacking side who last touched the puck shall be credited with the goal, but no assist shall be awarded. A goal shall be scored if the puck is put into the goal in any other manner by a Player of the defending side. The Player of the attacking side who last touched the puck shall be credited with the goal and assists may be awarded. If an attacking Player has the puck deflect into the net, off their skate or body, in any manner, the goal shall be allowed. The Player who deflected the puck shall be credited with the goal. Should a Player legally propel a puck into the Goal Crease of the opponent Team and the puck should become loose and available to another Player of the attacking side, a goal scored on the play shall be legal. Apparent goals shall be disallowed by the Referee and the appropriate announcement made by the Public Address Announcer for the following reasons: (I) When the puck has been directed with any part of their body (excl. skates), batted or thrown into the net by an attacking Player other than with a stick. When this occurs, if it is deemed to be done deliberately, then the decision shall be NO GOAL. A goal cannot be scored when the puck has been deliberately batted with any part of the attacking Player’s body into the net (Rule 78.4 – Scoring a Goal) (II) When the puck has been kicked using a distinct kicking motion (Rule 49.2 – Kicking) (III) When the puck has deflected directly into the net off an official (Rule 85.4 – Puck Striking Official) (IV) When a goal has been scored and an ineligible Player is on the ice (Rule 68.5 – Disallowed Goal) (V) When an attacking Player has interfered with a Goalkeeper in their Goal Crease (Rule 69.1 – Interference on the Goalkeeper) (VI) When the puck has entered the net after making contact with an attacking Player’s stick that is above the height of the crossbar. Where the puck makes contact with the stick is the determining factor (Rule 80.3 – Disallowed Goal) (VII) When Video Review confirms the scoring of a goal at one end of the ice, any goal scored at the other end on the same play must be disallowed (Rule 37.2 – Video Review) (VIII) When a Linesperson reports a Double-minor Penalty for high-sticking or a Major Penalty to the Referee following the scoring of a goal by the offending Team, the goal must be disallowed, and the appropriate penalty assessed (Rule 32.4 – Reporting to Referee) (IX) When a Goalkeeper has been pushed into the net together with the puck after making a save (Rule 69.7 – Rebounds and Loose Pucks) (X) When the net becomes displaced accidentally. The goal frame is considered to be displaced if either or both goal pegs are no longer in their respective holes in the ice, or the net has come completely off one or both pegs, prior to or as the puck enters the goal. However, if this occurs as a result of the actions of a defending player, refer to (Rule 63.7 – Awarded Goal) (XI) During the delayed calling of a penalty, the offending Team cannot score unless the non-offending Team shoots the puck into their own net. This shall mean that a deflection off an offending Player or any physical action by an offending Player that may cause the puck to enter the non-offending Team’s goal, shall not be considered a legal goal. Play shall be stopped before the puck enters the net (whenever possible) and the signaled penalty assessed to the offending Team; (XII) When the Referee deems the play has been stopped, even if they have not physically had the opportunity to stop play by blowing their whistle; (XIII) Any goal scored, other than as covered by the official rules, shall not be allowed.",

Any Player except a Goalkeeper of the Team may be designated to serve the penalty by the Coach through the playing Captain and such Player shall take their place in the Penalty Box promptly and serve the penalty as if it was a Minor Penalty imposed upon them.If a center should move prematurely prior to the “face-off”, or if the Referee or Linesperson shall have dropped the puck unfairly, the “face-off” shall be considered a “face-off” violation. A warning shall be issued to the offending Team and the “face-off” must be conducted again. When two (2) “face-off” violations” have been committed by the same Team during the same “face-off”, this Team shall be penalized with a Bench Minor Penalty to the offending Team. This penalty shall be announced as a “Bench Minor Penalty for “Delay of Game” – Face-off Violation.” “Face-off” violations shall be summarized as follows (any of the four (4) On-ice Officials may identify a “face-off” violation): (I) Encroachment by any Player other than the center into the “face-off” area prior to the puck being dropped. Players on the perimeter of the Face-off Circle must keep both skates outside the Face-off Circle – skate contact with the line is permitted. If a Player's skate crosses the line into the Face-off Circle prior to the drop of the puck, this shall be deemed as a “face-off” violation. A Player's stick may be inside the Face-off Circle provided there is no physical contact with their opponent or their opponent's stick. (II) Encroachment by any Player into the area between the hash marks on the outer edges of the Face-off Circle prior to the puck being dropped. Players must also ensure that both of their skates do not cross their respective hash marks. Contact with the line with their skate is permitted. If a Player's skate crosses the line into the area between the hash marks prior to the drop of the puck, this shall be deemed as a “face-off” violation. A Player's stick may be inside the area between the hash marks provided there is no physical contact with their opponent or their opponent's stick. (III) Any physical contact with an opponent prior to the puck being dropped. If either Player taking the “face-off” makes helmet-to-helmet contact with their opponent, they must receive a first “face-off” violation warning. If the Linesperson cannot differentiate which Player initiated the contact, both Players must receive a first “face-off” violation warning. (IV) Failure by either center taking the “face-off” to “properly position themself behind the restraining lines” or place their stick on the ice – as outlined in Rule 76.4 – Face-off Procedure – Centers. \"Properly position themself behind the restraining lines\" shall mean that the center must place their feet on either side of the restraining lines that are parallel to the side Boards (contact with the lines is permissible), and the toe of the blade of their skates must not cross over the restraining lines that are perpendicular to the side Boards as they approach the Face-off Spot. The blade of the stick must then be placed on the ice, at least the toe of the blade of the stick, in the designated white area of the Face-off Spot and must remain there until the puck is dropped. (V) Failure to comply with this positioning and “face-off” procedure will result in a “face-off” violation. Whenever a Team has committed two (2) “face-off” violations during the same “face-off”, the Referee shall immediately assess the offending Team a Bench Minor Penalty for “Delay of Game”. This penalty shall be announced as a Bench Minor Penalty for Delay of Game – Face-off Violation. Players who are late to the “face-off” location and therefore in an off-side position for the ensuing “face-off” will be warned once in the game by the Referee. This warning will also be given to the offending Team’s Coach. In this situation, the offending Team’s center will not receive a warning for a “face-off” violation. Any subsequent violation shall result in a Bench Minor Penalty for “Delay of Game” being assessed to the offending Team. This penalty shall be announced as a “Bench Minor Penalty for “Delay of Game” – Slow Proceeding to Face-off Location. In the conduct of any “face-off” at any of the nine (9) Face-off Spots on the playing surface, no Player facing-off shall make any physical contact with their opponent’s body by means of their own body or by their stick except in the course of playing the puck after the “face-off” has been completed. For violation of this rule, the Referee may, at their discretion impose a Minor Penalty or penalties on the Player(s) whose action(s) caused the “physical contact”. Nonetheless, this “physical contact” prior to the dropping of the puck shall be deemed as a “face-off” violation and the center will be warned by the Linesperson that the Team has committed a “face-off” violation and any subsequent violation will result in a Bench Minor Penalty for “Delay of Game” – “face-off” violation being assessed. “Face-off” encroachment may be applied during “face-offs” at any of the nine (9) Face-off Spots on the playing surface However, since no such lines are painted on the ice at the four (4) Face-off Spots adjacent to the Blue Lines, Linespersons shall use their judgment as to whether or not a violation has occurred. All Players, other than the centers, shall be uniformly back from the “face-off” location similar to being outside the Face-off Circle for “face-offs” in the End Zones.",

A warning shall be issued to the offending Team and the “face-off” must be conducted again.

This penalty shall be announced as a “Bench Minor Penalty for “Delay of Game” – Face-off Violation.” “Face-off” violations shall be summarized as follows (any of the four (4) On-ice Officials may identify a “face-off” violation): (I) Encroachment by any Player other than the center into the “face-off” area prior to the puck being dropped. Players on the perimeter of the Face-off Circle must keep both skates outside the Face-off Circle – skate contact with the line is permitted. If a Player's skate crosses the line into the Face-off Circle prior to the drop of the puck, this shall be deemed as a “face-off” violation.

(II) Encroachment by any Player into the area between the hash marks on the outer edges of the Face-off Circle prior to the puck being dropped. Players must also ensure that both of their skates do not cross their respective hash marks. Contact with the line with their skate is permitted. If a Player's skate crosses the line into the area between the hash marks prior to the drop of the puck, this shall be deemed as a “face-off” violation. A Player's stick may be inside the area between the hash marks provided there is no physical contact with their opponent or their opponent's stick. (III) Any physical contact with an opponent prior to the puck being dropped. If either Player taking the “face-off” makes helmet-to-helmet contact with their opponent, they must receive a first “face-off” violation warning.

When it is unclear as to which of the four (4) Face-off Spots is the nearest, the spot that gives the Home Team the greatest “territorial advantage” in the Neutral Zone will be selected for the ensuing “face-off”. When Players are penalized at a stoppage of play so as to result in penalties being placed on the penalty time clock to one Team, the ensuing “face-off” shall be conducted at one of the two (2) Face-off Spots in the offending Team’s Defending Zone.

The Team awarded the “Power-Play” will have the choice of which End Zone spot the “face-off” will take place at to start the “Power-Play”. When an infringement of a rule has been committed by Players of both Teams in the play resulting in the stoppage, the ensuing “face-off” will be conducted at the nearest Face-off Spot in that zone. When stoppage occurs between the end Face-off Spots and near end of the Rink, the puck shall be faced-off at the end Face-off Spot on the side where the stoppage occurs unless otherwise expressly provided by these rules. No “face-off” shall be made within 4.50 m of the goal or side Boards nor anywhere other than at a Face-off Spot. When a goal is illegally scored as a result of a puck being deflected directly off an Official, the resulting “face-off” shall be made at the nearest Face-off Spot in the zone where the puck deflected off of the Official. When a goal is illegally scored by the attacking Team by “directing”, “batting”, “kicking” or “high-sticking” the puck into the goal, the resulting “face-off” shall take place in the Neutral Zone at the nearest Face-off Spot. When the game is stopped for any reason not specifically covered in the official rules, the puck must be “faced-off” at a Face-off Spot in the zone nearest to where it was last played. Following a stoppage of play, should one or both defensemen who are the “point Players” or any Player coming from the Players’ Bench of the attacking Team, enter into the Attacking Zone beyond the outer edge of the End Zone Face-off Circle during an altercation, “gathering or scrum”, the ensuing “face-off” shall take place in the Neutral Zone near the Blue Line of the defending Team. This rule also applies when an “icing”, an “intentional off-side”, or a penalty has been assessed, and the ensuing “face-off” is to be in the offending Team’s Defending Zone. Should any of the non-offending Players enter the Attacking Zone beyond the outer edge of the End Zone Face-off Circle during an altercation, “gathering or scrum”, the ensuing “face-off” shall take place in the Neutral Zone near the Blue Line of the defending Team. For a violation of (Rule 71 – Premature Substitution) the resulting “face-off” will take place at the Center ice Face-off Spot when play is stopped beyond the Center red line. When play is stopped prior to the Center red line, the resulting “face-off” shall be conducted at the nearest Face-off Spot in the zone where the play was stopped. When play is stopped for an injured Player, the ensuing “face-off” shall be conducted at the Face-off Spot in the zone nearest the location of the puck when the play was stopped. When the injured Player’s Team has “control of the puck” in the Attacking Zone, the “face-off” shall be conducted at one of the Face-off Spots outside the Blue Line in the Neutral Zone. When the injured Player is in their Defending Zone and the attacking Team is in “control of the puck” in the Attacking Zone, the “face-off” shall be conducted at one of the defending Team’s end-zone Face-off Spots.",

If two (2) rule violations are the reason for the stoppage of play (e.g.: “high-sticking the puck” and “intentional off-side”), the ensuing “face-off location” shall be determined as the spot that provides the least amount of “territorial advantage” to the offending Team. When the play is stopped for any reason not specifically attributable to either Team while the puck is in the Neutral Zone, the ensuing “face-off” shall be conducted at the nearest Face-off Spot outside the Blue Line whenever possible. When it is unclear as to which of the four (4) Face-off Spots is the nearest, the spot that gives the Home Team the greatest “territorial advantage” in the Neutral Zone will be selected for the ensuing “face-off”. When Players are penalized at a stoppage of play so as to result in penalties being placed on the penalty time clock to one Team, the ensuing “face-off” shall be conducted at one of the two (2) Face-off Spots in the offending Team’s Defending Zone. There are only three (3) exceptions to this application: (I) when a penalty is assessed after the scoring of a goal – “face-off” shall be conducted at Center ice; (II) when a penalty is assessed at the end (or start) of a period – “face-off” shall be conducted at Center ice; (III) or when the defending Team is penalized, and the attacking Players enter the Attacking Zone beyond the outer edge of the End Zone Face-off Circle – “face-off” shall be conducted in the Neutral Zone. The Team awarded the “Power-Play” will have the choice of which End Zone spot the “face-off” will take place at to start the “Power-Play”. When an infringement of a rule has been committed by Players of both Teams in the play resulting in the stoppage, the ensuing “face-off” will be conducted at the nearest Face-off Spot in that zone. When stoppage occurs between the end Face-off Spots and near end of the Rink, the puck shall be faced-off at the end Face-off Spot on the side where the stoppage occurs unless otherwise expressly provided by these rules. No “face-off” shall be made within 4.50 m of the goal or side Boards nor anywhere other than at a Face-off Spot. When a goal is illegally scored as a result of a puck being deflected directly off an Official, the resulting “face-off” shall be made at the nearest Face-off Spot in the zone where the puck deflected off of the Official. When a goal is illegally scored by the attacking Team by “directing”, “batting”, “kicking” or “high-sticking” the puck into the goal, the resulting “face-off” shall take place in the Neutral Zone at the nearest Face-off Spot. When the game is stopped for any reason not specifically covered in the official rules, the puck must be “faced-off” at a Face-off Spot in the zone nearest to where it was last played. Following a stoppage of play, should one or both defensemen who are the “point Players” or any Player coming from the Players’ Bench of the attacking Team, enter into the Attacking Zone beyond the outer edge of the End Zone Face-off Circle during an altercation, “gathering or scrum”, the ensuing “face-off” shall take place in the Neutral Zone near the Blue Line of the defending Team. This rule also applies when an “icing”, an “intentional off-side”, or a penalty has been assessed, and the ensuing “face-off” is to be in the offending Team’s Defending Zone.

When play is stopped for an injured Player, the ensuing “face-off” shall be conducted at the Face-off Spot in the zone nearest the location of the puck when the play was stopped.

At the discretion of the On-ice Officials, should a substituting Player come onto the ice before their Teammate is within the 1.50 m limit of the Players’ Bench (and therefore clearly causing their Team to have “too many Players” on the ice), then a Bench Minor Penalty may be assessed. When a Player is retiring from the ice surface and is within the 1.50 m limit of their Players’ Bench, and their substitute is on the ice, then the retiring Player shall be considered off the ice for the purpose of Rule 70 – Leaving Players Bench or Penalty Box. If in the course of making a substitution, either the Player entering the game or the Player retiring from the ice surface plays the puck with their stick, skates or hands or who checks or makes any physical contact with an opposing Player while either the Player entering the game or the retiring Player is actually on the ice, then the infraction of “too many Players on the ice” will be called. If in the course of a substitution either the Player(s) entering the play or the Player(s) retiring is struck by the puck accidentally, the play will not be stopped, and no penalty will be called. During the play, the Player retiring from the ice must do so at the Players’ Bench and not through any other exit leading from the Rink. This is not a legal Player change and therefore when a violation occurs, a Bench Minor Penalty shall be imposed. A Player coming onto the ice as a substitute Player is considered on the ice once both of their skates are on the ice. If they play the puck or interfere with an opponent while still on the Players’ Bench, they shall be penalized under (Rule 56 – Interference) A retiring Player (coming off the ice) who has one skate on the ice and one skate off the ice in the Players’ Bench is considered as “off the ice”.If a Goalkeeper sustains an injury or becomes ill, they must be ready to resume play immediately or be replaced by a substitute Goalkeeper and no additional time shall be allowed for the purpose of enabling the injured or ill Goalkeeper to resume their position. No warm-up shall be permitted for a substitute Goalkeeper in any game. The substitute Goalkeeper shall be subject to the regular rules governing Goalkeepers and shall be entitled to the same privileges. When a substitution for the injured Goalkeeper has been made, the injured Goalkeeper is not allowed to resume the position until the next stoppage of play. For a violation of the rule, a Minor Penalty for “Delay of Game” shall be assessed. When play has been stopped by the Referee or Linesperson due to an injured Goalkeeper, such Goalkeeper must be substituted for only if they have to proceed to the Players’ Bench to receive medical attention. Where an injury has occurred to a Goalkeeper and there is a stoppage of play, a Team Doctor (or other Medical Personnel) may go onto the ice to attend to the injured Player without waiting for the Referee’s consent. If the Doctor or Medical Personnel has come onto the ice to attend to the Goalkeeper and there is no undue delay, the Goalkeeper may remain in the game. However, no additional time shall be permitted by the Referee for the purpose of enabling the injured Goalkeeper to resume their position (i.e., no warm-up).The Referee shall announce the reason for the assessed “Penalty Shot” and shall have the Skater selected by the Team entitled to take the “Penalty Shot” announced over the Public Address System. The puck shall then be placed on the Center Face-off Spot and the Player taking the “Penalty Shot” will, on the instruction of the Referee, by blowing their whistle, play the puck from there and shall attempt to score on the Goalkeeper. The puck must be kept in motion towards the opponent’s Goal Line and once it is shot, the play shall be considered complete. No goal can be scored on a rebound of any kind (an exception being the puck off the Goal Post or crossbar, then the Goalkeeper and then directly into the goal), and any time the puck crosses the Goal Line or comes to a complete stop, the “Penalty Shot” shall be considered complete. The “lacrosse-like move” whereby the puck is picked up on the blade of the stick and “whipped” into the net shall be permitted provided the puck is not raised above the height of the shoulders at any time and when released, is not carried higher than the crossbar. (Rule 80.1 – High-sticking the Puck) The “spin-o-rama type move” where the Player completes a 360° turn as they approach the goal, shall not be permitted. Should a Player perform such a move during the “Penalty Shot”, the shot shall be stopped by the Referee and no goal will be the result. Only a Player designated as a Goalkeeper or alternate Goalkeeper may defend against a “Penalty Shot”. The Goalkeeper must remain in their crease until the Player taking a “Penalty Shot” has touched the puck. If at the time a “Penalty Shot” is awarded, the Goalkeeper of the penalized Team has been removed from the ice to substitute another Player, the Goalkeeper shall be permitted to return to the ice before the “Penalty Shot” is taken. The Team against whom the “Penalty Shot” has been assessed may replace their Goalkeeper to defend against the shot, however, the substitute goalkeeper is required to remain in the game until the next stoppage of play. While the “Penalty Shot” is being taken, Players of both sides shall withdraw to the sides of the Rink and in front of their own Player’s Bench.Once the Goalkeeper has been removed for an extra Attacker in Overtime during the game, they must wait for the next stoppage of play before returning to their position. Any attempt by the Goalkeeper to return to his position prior to the next stoppage of play (“on the fly”) shall be deemed to be an “illegal substitution” and a Bench Minor penalty shall be assessed for having an ineligible Player would apply.Following the stoppage of play, the visiting Team shall promptly place a line-up on the ice ready for play and no substitution shall be made from that time until play has been resumed. The Home Team may then make any desired substitution, except in cases following an “icing”, which does not result in the delay of the game. “Placing a line-up on the ice” shall mean that both Teams shall place the full complement of Players (and not exceed) to which they are entitled within the line change time frame. If there is any undue delay by either Team in changing Players, the Referee shall order the offending Team or Teams to take their positions immediately and not permit any further Player changes. When a substitution has been made under the above rule, no additional substitution may be made until play commences. Once the line change procedure has been completed, no additional Player substitutions shall be permitted until the “face-off” has been completed legally and play has resumed, except when a penalty or penalties are imposed that affect the “on-ice strength” of either or both Teams. This may include penalties imposed following the completion of the line change and prior to the “face-off”, or due to a penalty assessed for a “face-off” violation – refer to Rule 82.2 – Line Change – Procedure. A Team that is in violation of (Rule 63.8 – Delaying the Game) or (Rule 81 – Icing) shall not be permitted to make any Player substitutions prior to the ensuing “face-off”. However, a Team shall be permitted to make a Player substitution to replace a Goalkeeper who had been substituted for an extra attacker, to replace an injured Player, or when a penalty has been assessed which affects the “on-ice strength” of either Team. The determination of Players on ice will be made when the puck leaves the offending Player’s stick. Goalkeepers’ substitution during a game will be conducted within the same time frame as a regular line change. No extra time will be allotted to the Goalkeeper coming off the bench, except in the case where an injury to a Goalkeeper occurs.",

Nevertheless, the Referee shall not stop play until the attacking Team has “lost possession” of the puck to the defending Team. The intention of this rule is to restore a reasonable “scoring opportunity” which has been lost. If, however, the Player fouled is able to recover and obtain a “reasonable scoring opportunity” (or a Teammate is able to gain a reasonable scoring opportunity), no “Penalty Shot” should be awarded but the appropriate penalty should be signaled and assessed if a goal is not scored on the play. “Control of the puck” means the act of propelling the puck with the stick, hand, or feet. In order for a “Penalty Shot” to be awarded for a Player being fouled from behind, the following four (4) criteria must have been met: (I) The infraction must have taken place in the Neutral or Attacking Zone (i.e., over the puck carrier’s own Blue Line); (II) The infraction must have been committed from behind (except a foul committed from the front by the Goalkeeper on a “breakaway” situation); (III) The Player in “possession and control” (or, in the judgment of the Referee, the Player clearly would have “obtained possession and control” of the puck) must have been denied a reasonable chance to score. The fact that the Player got a shot off does not automatically eliminate this play from the “Penalty Shot” consideration criteria. If the infraction was from behind and the Player was denied a “more reasonable scoring opportunity” due to the infraction, then the “Penalty Shot” should still be awarded; (IV) The Player in “possession and control” (or, in the judgment of the Referee, the Player clearly would have “obtained possession and control”) must have had no opposing Player between themself and the Goalkeeper. If, in the opinion of the Referee, a Player makes contact with the puck first and subsequently trips the opponent in so doing, no “Penalty Shot” will be awarded, but a Minor Penalty for “tripping” shall be assessed. It should be noted that if the attacking Player manages to get around the Goalkeeper and has no defending Player between them and the “open goal”, and they are fouled from behind by the Goalkeeper or another defending Player, no goal can be awarded since the Goalkeeper is still on the ice.

A Minor Penalty for “hooking” shall be assessed to any Player who uses the shaft of the stick above the upper hand to hold or hook an opponent.This rule is described under (Rule 25 – Awarded Goal)The Referee, at their discretion, may assess a Major Penalty to a Player guilty of “tripping” an opponent, and who recklessly endangers the fouled Player in a way that at the discretion of the Referee such Player would not be sufficiently sanctioned by imposing a Minor Penalty.When a Player, in the Neutral or Attacking Zone, in “control” of the puck (or who could have obtained “possession and control” of the puck) and having no other opponent to pass than the Goalkeeper, is fouled from behind, thus preventing a reasonable scoring opportunity, a “Penalty Shot” shall be awarded to the non-offending Team. Nevertheless, the Referee shall not stop play until the attacking Team has “lost possession” of the puck to the defending Team. The intention of this rule is to restore a reasonable “scoring opportunity” which has been lost. If, however, the Player fouled is able to recover and obtain a “reasonable scoring opportunity” (or a Teammate is able to gain a reasonable scoring opportunity), no “Penalty Shot” should be awarded but the appropriate penalty should be signaled and assessed if a goal is not scored on the play. “Control of the puck” means the act of propelling the puck with the stick, hand, or feet. In order for a “Penalty Shot” to be awarded for a Player being fouled from behind, the following four (4) criteria must have been met: (I) The infraction must have taken place in the Neutral or Attacking Zone (i.e., over the puck carrier’s own Blue Line); (II) The infraction must have been committed from behind (except a foul committed from the front by the Goalkeeper on a “breakaway” situation); (III) The Player in “possession and control” (or, in the judgment of the Referee, the Player clearly would have “obtained possession and control” of the puck) must have been denied a reasonable chance to score. The fact that the Player got a shot off does not automatically eliminate this play from the “Penalty Shot” consideration criteria. If the infraction was from behind and the Player was denied a “more reasonable scoring opportunity” due to the infraction, then the “Penalty Shot” should still be awarded; (IV) The Player in “possession and control” (or, in the judgment of the Referee, the Player clearly would have “obtained possession and control”) must have had no opposing Player between themself and the Goalkeeper. If, in the opinion of the Referee, a Player makes contact with the puck first and subsequently trips the opponent in so doing, no “Penalty Shot” will be awarded, but a Minor Penalty for “tripping” shall be assessed. It should be noted that if the attacking Player manages to get around the Goalkeeper and has no defending Player between them and the “open goal”, and they are fouled from behind by the Goalkeeper or another defending Player, no goal can be awarded since the Goalkeeper is still on the ice. A “Penalty Shot” would be awarded.",

The player is hooked from behind and the Referee raises the arm for a Penalty Shot. One second after the penalty is signaled the period ends. Even if the Team B player had not been hooked, the player would never have had time to skate down the ice with the puck to make an attempt on the goal.

If a goal is not scored, the puck shall be faced-off at either of the end Face-off Spots in the zone in which the “Penalty Shot” was attempted, except when another rule dictates the “face-off” location should be in an alternate location, such as when the “point men” enter the zone beyond the outer edge of the End-Zone Face-off Circle or when the attacking Team has been penalized on the same play. (Rule 76.2 – Face-off Locations)All “face-off” must be conducted on one of the nine (9) Face-off Spots located on the Rink. If two (2) rule violations are the reason for the stoppage of play (e.g.: “high-sticking the puck” and “intentional off-side”), the ensuing “face-off location” shall be determined as the spot that provides the least amount of “territorial advantage” to the offending Team. When the play is stopped for any reason not specifically attributable to either Team while the puck is in the Neutral Zone, the ensuing “face-off” shall be conducted at the nearest Face-off Spot outside the Blue Line whenever possible. When it is unclear as to which of the four (4) Face-off Spots is the nearest, the spot that gives the Home Team the greatest “territorial advantage” in the Neutral Zone will be selected for the ensuing “face-off”. When Players are penalized at a stoppage of play so as to result in penalties being placed on the penalty time clock to one Team, the ensuing “face-off” shall be conducted at one of the two (2) Face-off Spots in the offending Team’s Defending Zone. There are only three (3) exceptions to this application: (I) when a penalty is assessed after the scoring of a goal – “face-off” shall be conducted at Center ice; (II) when a penalty is assessed at the end (or start) of a period – “face-off” shall be conducted at Center ice; (III) or when the defending Team is penalized, and the attacking Players enter the Attacking Zone beyond the outer edge of the End Zone Face-off Circle – “face-off” shall be conducted in the Neutral Zone. The Team awarded the “Power-Play” will have the choice of which End Zone spot the “face-off” will take place at to start the “Power-Play”. When an infringement of a rule has been committed by Players of both Teams in the play resulting in the stoppage, the ensuing “face-off” will be conducted at the nearest Face-off Spot in that zone. When stoppage occurs between the end Face-off Spots and near end of the Rink, the puck shall be faced-off at the end Face-off Spot on the side where the stoppage occurs unless otherwise expressly provided by these rules. No “face-off” shall be made within 4.50 m of the goal or side Boards nor anywhere other than at a Face-off Spot. When a goal is illegally scored as a result of a puck being deflected directly off an Official, the resulting “face-off” shall be made at the nearest Face-off Spot in the zone where the puck deflected off of the Official. When a goal is illegally scored by the attacking Team by “directing”, “batting”, “kicking” or “high-sticking” the puck into the goal, the resulting “face-off” shall take place in the Neutral Zone at the nearest Face-off Spot. When the game is stopped for any reason not specifically covered in the official rules, the puck must be “faced-off” at a Face-off Spot in the zone nearest to where it was last played. Following a stoppage of play, should one or both defensemen who are the “point Players” or any Player coming from the Players’ Bench of the attacking Team, enter into the Attacking Zone beyond the outer edge of the End Zone Face-off Circle during an altercation, “gathering or scrum”, the ensuing “face-off” shall take place in the Neutral Zone near the Blue Line of the defending Team. This rule also applies when an “icing”, an “intentional off-side”, or a penalty has been assessed, and the ensuing “face-off” is to be in the offending Team’s Defending Zone. Should any of the non-offending Players enter the Attacking Zone beyond the outer edge of the End Zone Face-off Circle during an altercation, “gathering or scrum”, the ensuing “face-off” shall take place in the Neutral Zone near the Blue Line of the defending Team. For a violation of (Rule 71 – Premature Substitution) the resulting “face-off” will take place at the Center ice Face-off Spot when play is stopped beyond the Center red line. When play is stopped prior to the Center red line, the resulting “face-off” shall be conducted at the nearest Face-off Spot in the zone where the play was stopped. When play is stopped for an injured Player, the ensuing “face-off” shall be conducted at the Face-off Spot in the zone nearest the location of the puck when the play was stopped. When the injured Player’s Team has “control of the puck” in the Attacking Zone, the “face-off” shall be conducted at one of the Face-off Spots outside the Blue Line in the Neutral Zone. When the injured Player is in their Defending Zone and the attacking Team is in “control of the puck” in the Attacking Zone, the “face-off” shall be conducted at one of the defending Team’s end-zone Face-off Spots.",

In the first situation above, the point players for the attacking team entered the zone beyond the outer edge of the end zone faceoff circle during an altercation, gathering or “scrum” and therefore, the face-off must be moved to the neutral zone near the blue line of the defending team following the unsuccessful Penalty Shot attempt (Rule 76.2). In the second situation above, the attacking team is penalized following the awarding of the Penalty Shot. Therefore, following the unsuccessful Penalty Shot attempt, the ensuing face-off must be taken to the penalized team’s (Team B’s) defending zone at one of the end zone face-off spots (Rule 76.2.).",

Should the first “Penalty Shot” result in a goal, the second “Penalty Shot” would not be taken but the appropriate penalty would be assessed and served for the infraction committed.When a Player, in the Neutral or Attacking Zone, in “control” of the puck (or who could have obtained “possession and control” of the puck) and having no other opponent to pass than the Goalkeeper, is fouled from behind, thus preventing a reasonable scoring opportunity, a “Penalty Shot” shall be awarded to the non-offending Team. Nevertheless, the Referee shall not stop play until the attacking Team has “lost possession” of the puck to the defending Team. The intention of this rule is to restore a reasonable “scoring opportunity” which has been lost. If, however, the Player fouled is able to recover and obtain a “reasonable scoring opportunity” (or a Teammate is able to gain a reasonable scoring opportunity), no “Penalty Shot” should be awarded but the appropriate penalty should be signaled and assessed if a goal is not scored on the play. “Control of the puck” means the act of propelling the puck with the stick, hand, or feet. In order for a “Penalty Shot” to be awarded for a Player being fouled from behind, the following four (4) criteria must have been met: (I) The infraction must have taken place in the Neutral or Attacking Zone (i.e., over the puck carrier’s own Blue Line); (II) The infraction must have been committed from behind (except a foul committed from the front by the Goalkeeper on a “breakaway” situation); (III) The Player in “possession and control” (or, in the judgment of the Referee, the Player clearly would have “obtained possession and control” of the puck) must have been denied a reasonable chance to score. The fact that the Player got a shot off does not automatically eliminate this play from the “Penalty Shot” consideration criteria. If the infraction was from behind and the Player was denied a “more reasonable scoring opportunity” due to the infraction, then the “Penalty Shot” should still be awarded; (IV) The Player in “possession and control” (or, in the judgment of the Referee, the Player clearly would have “obtained possession and control”) must have had no opposing Player between themself and the Goalkeeper. If, in the opinion of the Referee, a Player makes contact with the puck first and subsequently trips the opponent in so doing, no “Penalty Shot” will be awarded, but a Minor Penalty for “tripping” shall be assessed. It should be noted that if the attacking Player manages to get around the Goalkeeper and has no defending Player between them and the “open goal”, and they are fouled from behind by the Goalkeeper or another defending Player, no goal can be awarded since the Goalkeeper is still on the ice.

However, in the question above, only one of the two infractions  result in a Penalty Shot because only one of the infractions meets all the criteria for a Penalty Shot.

When a Major Penalty is committed by the Goalkeeper that causes the shot to fail, the Referee shall permit the “Penalty Shot” to be taken over again and the appropriate penalties shall be assessed to the Goalkeeper. The Goalkeeper may attempt to stop the “Penalty Shot” in any manner except by throwing their stick or any object, deliberately removes their helmet and/or face mask, or by deliberately dislodging the goal, in which case a goal shall be awarded. During the “Penalty Shot”, should the Goalkeeper, in an attempt at making a save, dislodge the goal accidentally, the Referee shall make one of the following determinations: (I) Award a goal if they deem the Player would have scored into the area normally occupied by the net had it not been dislodged. (II) Allow the “Penalty Shot” to be re-taken if they do not score or it could not be determined if the puck would have entered the area normally occupied by the net. (III) If the goal becomes dislodged after the puck has crossed the Goal Line thus ending the “Penalty Shot”, the above determinations do not apply, the “Penalty Shot” is complete. If, while a “Penalty Shot” is being taken, any Player, Coach or team personnel of the opposing Team interferes with or distracts the Player taking the “Penalty Shot” and, because of such action, the “Penalty Shot” fails, a second (2nd) attempt shall be permitted. The Referee shall impose a Bench Minor Penalty to the offending Team, and if a Player on the Bench is responsible, a Misconduct Penalty on the Player responsible shall be assessed. When a Coach or team personnel is guilty of such an act, a Game Misconduct Penalty shall be assessed on the responsible person and the matter will be reported to the Proper Authorities for possible further disciplinary action. If, while the “Penalty Shot” is being taken, any Player, Coach or team personnel of the Team taking the “Penalty Shot” interferes with or distracts the Goalkeeper defending the “Penalty Shot” and, because of such action, the shot is successful, the Referee shall rule no goal and shall impose a Bench Minor Penalty to the offending Team. If while the “Penalty Shot” is being taken a spectator throws any object onto the ice that in the judgment of the Referee interferes with the Player taking the “Penalty Shot” or the Goalkeeper defending the “Penalty Shot”, they shall permit the “Penalty Shot” to be taken again.

Nevertheless, the Referee shall not stop play until the attacking Team has “lost possession” of the puck to the defending Team. The intention of this rule is to restore a reasonable “scoring opportunity” which has been lost. If, however, the Player fouled is able to recover and obtain a “reasonable scoring opportunity” (or a Teammate is able to gain a reasonable scoring opportunity), no “Penalty Shot” should be awarded but the appropriate penalty should be signaled and assessed if a goal is not scored on the play. “Control of the puck” means the act of propelling the puck with the stick, hand, or feet. In order for a “Penalty Shot” to be awarded for a Player being fouled from behind, the following four (4) criteria must have been met: (I) The infraction must have taken place in the Neutral or Attacking Zone (i.e., over the puck carrier’s own Blue Line); (II) The infraction must have been committed from behind (except a foul committed from the front by the Goalkeeper on a “breakaway” situation); (III) The Player in “possession and control” (or, in the judgment of the Referee, the Player clearly would have “obtained possession and control” of the puck) must have been denied a reasonable chance to score. The fact that the Player got a shot off does not automatically eliminate this play from the “Penalty Shot” consideration criteria. If the infraction was from behind and the Player was denied a “more reasonable scoring opportunity” due to the infraction, then the “Penalty Shot” should still be awarded; (IV) The Player in “possession and control” (or, in the judgment of the Referee, the Player clearly would have “obtained possession and control”) must have had no opposing Player between themself and the Goalkeeper. If, in the opinion of the Referee, a Player makes contact with the puck first and subsequently trips the opponent in so doing, no “Penalty Shot” will be awarded, but a Minor Penalty for “tripping” shall be assessed. It should be noted that if the attacking Player manages to get around the Goalkeeper and has no defending Player between them and the “open goal”, and they are fouled from behind by the Goalkeeper or another defending Player, no goal can be awarded since the Goalkeeper is still on the ice.

During the play, if an injured Player wishes to retire from the ice and be replaced by a substitute, they must do so at the Players’ Bench and not through any other exit leading from the Rink. This is not a legal Player change and therefore when a violation occurs, a Bench-minor Penalty shall be imposed. If a penalized Player has been injured, they may proceed to the Dressing Room without taking a seat in the Penalty Box. The penalized Team shall immediately put a substitute Player in the Penalty Box, who shall serve the penalty until the injured Player is able to return to the game. They would replace their Teammate in the Penalty Box at the next stoppage of play. For violation of this rule, a Bench Minor Penalty shall be imposed. Should the injured penalized Player who has been replaced in the Penalty Box return to their Players’ Bench prior to the expiration of their penalty, they shall not be eligible to play until their penalty has expired. This includes coincidental penalties when their substitute is still in the Penalty Box awaiting a stoppage in play. The injured Player must wait until their substitute has been released from the Penalty Box before they are eligible to play. If, however, there is a stoppage of play prior to the expiration of their penalty, they must then replace their Teammate in the Penalty Box and is then eligible to return once their penalty has expired. When a Player is injured so that they cannot continue play or go to their Players’ Bench, the play shall not be stopped until the injured Player’s Team has secured control of the puck. If the Player’s Team is in “control of the puck” at the time of injury, play shall be stopped immediately unless their Team is in a scoring position. In the case where it is obvious that a Player has sustained a serious injury, the Referee and/or Linesperson may stop the play immediately. Where an injury has occurred to a Player and there is a stoppage of play, a Team Doctor (or other Medical Personnel) may go onto the ice to attend to the injured Player without waiting for the Referee’s consent. When play has been stopped by the Referee or Linesperson due to an injured Player, or whenever an injured Player is attended to on the ice by the Coach or Medical Personnel, such Player must be substituted for immediately. This injured Player cannot return to the ice until play has resumed. When play is stopped for an injured Player, the ensuing “face-off” shall be conducted at the Face-off Spot in the zone nearest the location of the puck when the play was stopped. When the injured Player’s Team has control of the puck in the Attacking Zone, the “face-off” shall be conducted at the nearest Faceoff Spot in the Neutral Zone. When the injured Player is in their Defending Zone and the attacking Team is in “possession of the puck” in the Attacking Zone, the “face-off” shall be conducted at the nearest Face-off Spot in the defending Team’s zone. A player who lies on the ice either feigning an injury or refusing to get up off the ice will be issued a Minor Penalty.A Goalkeeper shall not be sent to the Penalty Box for an offense which incurs a Minor Penalty, but instead, the Minor Penalty shall be served by another member of their Team who was on the ice when the offense was committed. This Player is to be designated by the Coach of the offending Team through the playing Captain and such substitute shall not be changed. A penalized Player may not serve a Goalkeeper’s penalty. If the Goalkeeper is involved in Coincidental Penalties being assessed and as a result, their Team is required to play “short-handed” due to additional penalties assessed to the Goalkeeper, the Player designated to serve the additional time penalties assessed to the Goalkeeper may be any Player as designated by the Coach of the offending Team through the Captain.",

Regarding to a Goalkeeper, this rule applies outside of their Goal Crease area; (II) On any Player who deliberately shoots or bats (using their hand or stick) the puck outside the playing area (from anywhere on the ice surface) during the play or after a stoppage of play; (III) On any Player who shoots or bats (using their hand or stick) the puck directly (non-deflected) out of the playing surface from their Defending Zone, except where there is no Protective Glass. The determining factor shall be the position of the puck when it was shot or batted by the offending Player. If contact with the puck occurs while the puck is inside the Defending Zone, and subsequently goes out of play, the Minor Penalty shall be assessed. When the puck is shot over the Protective Glass surrounding the Players’ Bench, the penalty will be assessed. Note: When the puck is shot into the Players’ Bench, the penalty will not apply. When the puck goes out of the playing area directly off a “face-off”, no penalty shall be assessed; (IV) On any Player who delays the game by deliberately displacing a Goal Post from its normal position. The Referee shall stop play immediately when the offending Team gains “control” of the puck. Note: If a Player deliberately displaces a Goal Post from its normal position when an opponent has an imminent scoring opportunity on an open net, a goal may be awarded by the Referee (Rule 63.7 – Awarded Goal) (V) On a Player other than the Goalkeeper who deliberately falls on or gathers the puck into their body; Note: Any Player who drops to their knees to block a shot should not be penalized if the puck is shot under them or becomes lodged in their clothing or equipment but any use of the hands to make the puck unplayable should be penalized promptly; (VI) On a Goalkeeper who “races out” of their Goal Crease in an attempt to beat the attacking Player to the puck and instead of playing the puck jumps on the puck causing a stoppage of play; Note: If a Goalkeeper comes out of their Goal Crease to “cut down the angle” on a shot and after making the save covers the puck, this shall be legal. (VII) On a Goalkeeper who, when they are in their own Goal Crease, deliberately falls on or gathers the puck into their body or who holds or places the puck against any part of the goal in such a manner as to cause a stoppage of play unless they are actually being checked by an opponent; (VIII) On a Goalkeeper who plays the puck outside of the Designated Area behind the net. The determining factor shall be the position of the puck. Note: The Minor Penalty will not be assessed when a Goalkeeper plays the puck while maintaining skate contact with the Goal Crease. (IX) For adjustments to clothing, equipment, skates, or sticks. Note: No penalty should be assessed when a water bottle is delivered to a Goalkeeper, however, this should be conducted during time-outs and if, in the opinion of the Referee, it is being done to intentionally delay the game, a Minor Penalty may be assessed. (X) No delay shall be permitted for the repair or adjustment of Goalkeeper’s equipment. If adjustments are required, the Goalkeeper shall leave the ice and their place shall be taken by the substitute Goalkeeper immediately.

(Rule 69 – Interference on the Goalkeeper) ( » For more information regarding implementation of video review system refer to IIHF Event Codes.)Apparent goals shall be disallowed by the Referee and the appropriate announcement made by the Public Address Announcer for the following reasons: (I) When the puck has been directed with any part of their body (excl. skates), batted or thrown into the net by an attacking Player other than with a stick. When this occurs, if it is deemed to be done deliberately, then the decision shall be NO GOAL. A goal cannot be scored when the puck has been deliberately batted with any part of the attacking Player’s body into the net (Rule 78.4 – Scoring a Goal) (II) When the puck has been kicked using a distinct kicking motion (Rule 49.2 – Kicking) (III) When the puck has deflected directly into the net off an official (Rule 85.4 – Puck Striking Official) (IV) When a goal has been scored and an ineligible Player is on the ice (Rule 68.5 – Disallowed Goal) (V) When an attacking Player has interfered with a Goalkeeper in their Goal Crease (Rule 69.1 – Interference on the Goalkeeper) (VI) When the puck has entered the net after making contact with an attacking Player’s stick that is above the height of the crossbar. Where the puck makes contact with the stick is the determining factor (Rule 80.3 – Disallowed Goal) (VII) When Video Review confirms the scoring of a goal at one end of the ice, any goal scored at the other end on the same play must be disallowed (Rule 37.2 – Video Review) (VIII) When a Linesperson reports a Double-minor Penalty for high-sticking or a Major Penalty to the Referee following the scoring of a goal by the offending Team, the goal must be disallowed, and the appropriate penalty assessed (Rule 32.4 – Reporting to Referee) (IX) When a Goalkeeper has been pushed into the net together with the puck after making a save (Rule 69.7 – Rebounds and Loose Pucks) (X) When the net becomes displaced accidentally. The goal frame is considered to be displaced if either or both goal pegs are no longer in their respective holes in the ice, or the net has come completely off one or both pegs, prior to or as the puck enters the goal. However, if this occurs as a result of the actions of a defending player, refer to (Rule 63.7 – Awarded Goal) (XI) During the delayed calling of a penalty, the offending Team cannot score unless the non-offending Team shoots the puck into their own net. This shall mean that a deflection off an offending Player or any physical action by an offending Player that may cause the puck to enter the non-offending Team’s goal, shall not be considered a legal goal. Play shall be stopped before the puck enters the net (whenever possible) and the signaled penalty assessed to the offending Team; (XII) When the Referee deems the play has been stopped, even if they have not physically had the opportunity to stop play by blowing their whistle; (XIII) Any goal scored, other than as covered by the official rules, shall not be allowed.",

                    "context": "It is the responsibility of the Referees to award goals and report the ”goal scorer” and “assists”, and their decision in this respect is final, notwithstanding the report of the Referee or any other Game Official. The Officials Scorekeeper, with the assistance of the Statistic staff will confirm the “goal scorer” and any Player deserving an “assist”. This decision is final in this regard and no changes can be made after the conclusion of the game. The use of video replay to verify the proper awarding of a goal or an assist is essential. Such awards shall be made or withheld strictly in accordance with the provisions of this rule. Therefore, it is essential that the Official Scorekeeper be thoroughly familiar with every aspect of this rule; be alerted to observe all actions which could affect the awarding of a goal or assist; and, above all, give or withhold awards with absolute impartiality. In case of an obvious error in awarding a goal or an assist that has been announced, it should be corrected promptly, but changes should not be made in the official scoring summary after the Referee has signed the game report. The Team scoring the greatest number of goals during the three (3) twenty-minute periods shall be the winner and shall be credited with three (3) points in the standings. In the event a winner during the Round Robin or Preliminary Round is determined in the Overtime period or the shootout, the winning Team shall be credited with two (2) points in the standings and the losing Team will be credited with one (1) point in the standings. A “goal” shall be credited in the scoring records to a Player who shall have propelled the puck into the opponent’s goal. Each “goal” shall count one point in the Player’s record. Only one point can be credited to any one Player on a goal. When a Player scores a goal, an “assist” shall be credited to the Player or Players (maximum two) who touch the puck prior to the “goal scorer” provided no defender plays or has “control of the puck” subsequently. Each “assist” shall count one point in the Player’s record. Only one point can be credited to any one Player on a goal. A goal shall be scored when the puck shall have been put between the Goal Posts by the stick of a Player of the attacking side, from in front and below the crossbar, and entirely across a red line the width of the diameter of the Goal Posts drawn on the ice from one Goal Post to the other with the goal frame in its proper position. The goal frame shall be considered in its proper position when at least a portion of the flexible peg(s) are still inside both the Goal post and the hole in the ice. The flexible pegs could be bent, but as long as at least a portion of the flexible peg(s) are still in the hole in the ice and the Goal Post, the goal frame shall be deemed to be in its proper position. The goal frame could be raised somewhat on one post (or both), but as long as the flexible pegs are still in contact with the holes in the ice and the Goal Posts, the goal frame shall not be deemed to be displaced. A goal shall be scored if the puck is shot into the goal by a Player of the defending side. The Player of the attacking side who last touched the puck shall be credited with the goal, but no assist shall be awarded. A goal shall be scored if the puck is put into the goal in any other manner by a Player of the defending side. The Player of the attacking side who last touched the puck shall be credited with the goal and assists may be awarded. If an attacking Player has the puck deflect into the net, off their skate or body, in any manner, the goal shall be allowed. The Player who deflected the puck shall be credited with the goal. Should a Player legally propel a puck into the Goal Crease of the opponent Team and the puck should become loose and available to another Player of the attacking side, a goal scored on the play shall be legal. Apparent goals shall be disallowed by the Referee and the appropriate announcement made by the Public Address Announcer for the following reasons: (I) When the puck has been directed with any part of their body (excl. skates), batted or thrown into the net by an attacking Player other than with a stick. When this occurs, if it is deemed to be done deliberately, then the decision shall be NO GOAL. A goal cannot be scored when the puck has been deliberately batted with any part of the attacking Player’s body into the net (Rule 78.4 – Scoring a Goal) (II) When the puck has been kicked using a distinct kicking motion (Rule 49.2 – Kicking) (III) When the puck has deflected directly into the net off an official (Rule 85.4 – Puck Striking Official) (IV) When a goal has been scored and an ineligible Player is on the ice (Rule 68.5 – Disallowed Goal) (V) When an attacking Player has interfered with a Goalkeeper in their Goal Crease (Rule 69.1 – Interference on the Goalkeeper) (VI) When the puck has entered the net after making contact with an attacking Player’s stick that is above the height of the crossbar. Where the puck makes contact with the stick is the determining factor (Rule 80.3 – Disallowed Goal) (VII) When Video Review confirms the scoring of a goal at one end of the ice, any goal scored at the other end on the same play must be disallowed (Rule 37.2 – Video Review) (VIII) When a Linesperson reports a Double-minor Penalty for high-sticking or a Major Penalty to the Referee following the scoring of a goal by the offending Team, the goal must be disallowed, and the appropriate penalty assessed (Rule 32.4 – Reporting to Referee) (IX) When a Goalkeeper has been pushed into the net together with the puck after making a save (Rule 69.7 – Rebounds and Loose Pucks) (X) When the net becomes displaced accidentally. The goal frame is considered to be displaced if either or both goal pegs are no longer in their respective holes in the ice, or the net has come completely off one or both pegs, prior to or as the puck enters the goal. However, if this occurs as a result of the actions of a defending player, refer to (Rule 63.7 – Awarded Goal) (XI) During the delayed calling of a penalty, the offending Team cannot score unless the non-offending Team shoots the puck into their own net. This shall mean that a deflection off an offending Player or any physical action by an offending Player that may cause the puck to enter the non-offending Team’s goal, shall not be considered a legal goal. Play shall be stopped before the puck enters the net (whenever possible) and the signaled penalty assessed to the offending Team; (XII) When the Referee deems the play has been stopped, even if they have not physically had the opportunity to stop play by blowing their whistle; (XIII) Any goal scored, other than as covered by the official rules, shall not be allowed.The Referees shall have general supervision of the game and shall have full control of all off-ice Game Officials and Players during the game, including stoppages; and in case of any dispute, their decision shall be final. As there is a human factor involved in blowing the whistle to stop play, the Referee may deem the play to be stopped slightly prior to the whistle actually being blown. The fact that the puck may come loose or cross the Goal Line prior to the sound of the whistle has no bearing if the Referee has ruled that the play had been stopped prior to this happening. In the event of any dispute regarding time or the expiration of penalties, the matter shall be referred to the Referee for adjustment and their decision shall be final. They may use the Video Review Consultant to assist in rendering the final decision. (Rule 37 – Video Review) and (Rule 38 – Coach’s Challenge)All Players shall wear a helmet of design, material and construction approved for ice hockey, with a chin strap always properly fastened, including during “pre-game warm-up”, participating in the game, either on the playing surface or the Players’ Benches or Penalty Boxes. The helmet should be attached in such a way that it cannot fall off. If it falls off and has not been removed by an opponent Player, it has not been attached correctly. A Player on the ice whose helmet comes off during play has to exit the playing surface immediately. A player on the ice whose helmet comes off during play is not allowed to retrieve and put their helmet back on their head – for this they have to proceed to their Players’ Bench and exit the playing surface. If a Player does not comply with this rule, they shall be assessed a Minor Penalty without a warning (Rule 12 – Illegal Equipment) If the Player returns to their Players’ Bench to be substituted for, they may only return to the ice during play with a helmet (with the chin strap properly fastened). No Player may exit the Penalty Box during play without a helmet (with the chin strap properly fastened). Should they do so, the play shall be stopped once their Team has gained control of the puck and a Minor Penalty shall be assessed to the offending Player. If a Player’s chin strap becomes unfastened during game action, but the helmet stays on their head, they may continue to play until the next stoppage or until they leave the ice. A Player who intentionally removes an opponent’s helmet during play shall be assessed a Minor Penalty for “Roughing”. (Rule 51 – Roughing) When a goalkeeper is hit on the face mask by a hard shot with the puck and the Referee believes the Goalkeeper is or may be dazed by that hard shot, the Referee may stop play for safety reasons, if there is no immediate scoring chance for the attacking Team. When a Goalkeeper has lost their helmet and/or face mask and their Team has control of the puck, play shall be stopped immediately to allow the Goalkeeper the opportunity to recollect their helmet and/or face mask. When the opposing Team has control of the puck, play shall only be stopped if there is no immediate and impending scoring opportunity. This stoppage of play must be made by the Referee. When play is stopped because the Goalkeeper has lost their helmet and/ or face mask, the ensuing “face-off” shall take place at one of the defending Team’s End Zone Face-off Spots. When a Goalkeeper deliberately removes their helmet and/or face mask to secure a stoppage of play, the Referee shall stop play as outlined above and assess the Goalkeeper a Minor Penalty for “Delay of Game”. (Rule 63 – Delaying the Game) If the Goalkeeper deliberately removes their helmet and/or face mask when the opposing Team is on a breakaway (where the criteria’s for a penalty shot is meet except for a foul from behind), or during the course of a “Penalty Shot” or shootout attempt, the Referee shall award a goal to the non-offending Team.Apparent goals shall be disallowed by the Referee and the appropriate announcement made by the Public Address Announcer for the following reasons: (I) When the puck has been directed with any part of their body (excl. skates), batted or thrown into the net by an attacking Player other than with a stick. When this occurs, if it is deemed to be done deliberately, then the decision shall be NO GOAL. A goal cannot be scored when the puck has been deliberately batted with any part of the attacking Player’s body into the net (Rule 78.4 – Scoring a Goal) (II) When the puck has been kicked using a distinct kicking motion (Rule 49.2 – Kicking) (III) When the puck has deflected directly into the net off an official (Rule 85.4 – Puck Striking Official) (IV) When a goal has been scored and an ineligible Player is on the ice (Rule 68.5 – Disallowed Goal) (V) When an attacking Player has interfered with a Goalkeeper in their Goal Crease (Rule 69.1 – Interference on the Goalkeeper) (VI) When the puck has entered the net after making contact with an attacking Player’s stick that is above the height of the crossbar.

The Goalkeeper is considered off the ice once the replacement Player has entered the Playing Surface. If deemed appropriate, Supplementary Discipline can be applied by the Proper Authorities at their discretion.

(III) For encroachment into the “face-off” area (Rule 76 – Face-offs) . (IV) When the puck has been directed with a hand to a Teammate in any zone other than the Defending Zone and this has gone undetected by either of the Referees (Rule 79 – Hand Pass) . (V) When the puck has been batted with the hand by either center in an attempt to win the “face-off” in any zone (Rule 76 – Face-offs) . (VI) When the puck is struck by a stick above the normal height of the shoulders, and this has gone undetected by either of the Referees (Rule 80 – High-sticking the Puck) . (VII) When either Team “ices” the puck (Rule 81 – Icing) . (VIII) When there have been interference by/with spectators (Rule 24 – Penalty Shot) . (IX) For any infraction of the rules concerning “Off-side” play at the Blue Line (Rule 83 – Off-side) . (X) When the puck is “out of bounds” or unplayable (Rule 85 – Puck Out of Bounds) . (XI) When a goal has been scored that has not been observed by the Referees (Rule 78 – Goals) . (XII) When the puck is interfered with by an ineligible Player/person (Rule 5 – Team) , (Rule 74 – Too many Players on the Ice) , (Rule 78 – Goals) , (Rule 84 – Overtime Operations) (XIII) The calling of a “Penalty Shot” under (Rule 53 – Throwing Equipment)",

If a Player leaves the Penalty Box before their penalty is fully served, the Penalty Timekeeper shall note the time and signal the On-ice Officials who will stop play when the offending Player’s Team obtains “control of the puck”. An additional Minor Penalty must be served by this Player in addition to the time remaining in their original penalty (this unexpired time is calculated from the time they left the Penalty Box illegally). In the case of a Player returning to the ice before their time has expired through an error of the Penalty Timekeeper, they are not to serve an additional penalty, but must serve their unexpired time this unexpired time is calculated from the time they left the Penalty Box through the error of the Penalty Timekeeper. At a stoppage of play following the expiration of their penalties, if a Player or Players exiting the Penalty Box get involved in an altercation, those coming from the Penalty Box shall be assessed the penalties they incur in the altercation. Should a Player coming from the Penalty Box at a stoppage of play get involved with an opponent and the opponent is deemed to be the instigator of the altercation, then the Player coming from the Penalty Box would not be subject to the Game Misconduct Penalty. If deemed appropriate, Supplementary Discipline can be applied by the Proper Authorities at their discretion. (Rule 28 – Supplementary Discipline)The Penalty Timekeeper shall keep a correct record of all penalties imposed by the On-ice Game Officials, including the names of the Players penalized, the penalties assessed, the duration of each penalty and the time at which each penalty was imposed. This information shall also be recorded by the scorekeeper on the Official Game Sheet. The Penalty Timekeeper shall inform penalized Players and the Penalty Box Attendants as to the correct expiration time of all penalties. In the event of a malfunction of the Penalty Time Clock, the Game Clock shall be utilized to determine the expiration time of each penalty. Otherwise, the Penalty Time Clocks shall be the official timing device for all penalties that require a Team to play with less than five (5) Skaters. Players shall only be released from the Penalty Box when indicated by the Penalty Time Clock or as otherwise covered in the playing rules. The infraction of the rules for which each penalty has been imposed will be announced over the Public Address System as reported by the Referee. Where Players of both Teams are penalized at the same time, the penalty to the visiting Player will be announced first. In situations where multiple Game Misconduct Penalties have been assessed to any one (1) Player at the same stoppage of play, only one (1) Game Misconduct Penalty should be announced. Misconduct Penalties and coincident Major Penalties should not be recorded on the timing device (Penalty Time Clock) but such penalized Players should be alerted and released at the first stoppage of play following the expiration of their penalties. When a Player is assessed a Misconduct Penalty in addition to other penalties, the Misconduct Penalty shall only commence after all other penalties have been served (or washed out by the scoring of a goal). If a Player leaves the Penalty Box before the time has expired, the Penalty Timekeeper must note the time and notify the Referees at their first opportunity. It is the responsibility of the Penalty Timekeeper to ensure that penalized Players return to the Penalty Box before the puck is dropped for the start of a new period. In the event a penalized Player is not in the Penalty Box, the Penalty Timekeeper should notify the Referees and prevent the game from resuming until the Player is there.If a penalized Player returns to the ice from the Penalty Box before their penalty has expired by their own error or the error of the Penalty Timekeeper, any goal scored by their own Team while they are illegally on the ice shall be disallowed but all penalties imposed on either Team shall be served as regular penalties. If a Player shall illegally enter the game from their own Players’ Bench or from the Penalty Box, any goal scored by their own Team while they are illegally on the ice shall be disallowed but all penalties imposed on either Team shall be served as regular penalties.Apparent goals shall be disallowed by the Referee and the appropriate announcement made by the Public Address Announcer for the following reasons: (I) When the puck has been directed with any part of their body (excl. skates), batted or thrown into the net by an attacking Player other than with a stick. When this occurs, if it is deemed to be done deliberately, then the decision shall be NO GOAL. A goal cannot be scored when the puck has been deliberately batted with any part of the attacking Player’s body into the net (Rule 78.4 – Scoring a Goal) (II) When the puck has been kicked using a distinct kicking motion (Rule 49.2 – Kicking) (III) When the puck has deflected directly into the net off an official (Rule 85.4 – Puck Striking Official) (IV) When a goal has been scored and an ineligible Player is on the ice (Rule 68.5 – Disallowed Goal) (V) When an attacking Player has interfered with a Goalkeeper in their Goal Crease (Rule 69.1 – Interference on the Goalkeeper) (VI) When the puck has entered the net after making contact with an attacking Player’s stick that is above the height of the crossbar. Where the puck makes contact with the stick is the determining factor (Rule 80.3 – Disallowed Goal) (VII) When Video Review confirms the scoring of a goal at one end of the ice, any goal scored at the other end on the same play must be disallowed (Rule 37.2 – Video Review) (VIII) When a Linesperson reports a Double-minor Penalty for high-sticking or a Major Penalty to the Referee following the scoring of a goal by the offending Team, the goal must be disallowed, and the appropriate penalty assessed (Rule 32.4 – Reporting to Referee) (IX) When a Goalkeeper has been pushed into the net together with the puck after making a save (Rule 69.7 – Rebounds and Loose Pucks) (X) When the net becomes displaced accidentally. The goal frame is considered to be displaced if either or both goal pegs are no longer in their respective holes in the ice, or the net has come completely off one or both pegs, prior to or as the puck enters the goal. However, if this occurs as a result of the actions of a defending player, refer to (Rule 63.7 – Awarded Goal) (XI) During the delayed calling of a penalty, the offending Team cannot score unless the non-offending Team shoots the puck into their own net. This shall mean that a deflection off an offending Player or any physical action by an offending Player that may cause the puck to enter the non-offending Team’s goal, shall not be considered a legal goal. Play shall be stopped before the puck enters the net (whenever possible) and the signaled penalty assessed to the offending Team; (XII) When the Referee deems the play has been stopped, even if they have not physically had the opportunity to stop play by blowing their whistle; (XIII) Any goal scored, other than as covered by the official rules, shall not be allowed.",

This information shall also be recorded by the scorekeeper on the Official Game Sheet. The Penalty Timekeeper shall inform penalized Players and the Penalty Box Attendants as to the correct expiration time of all penalties. In the event of a malfunction of the Penalty Time Clock, the Game Clock shall be utilized to determine the expiration time of each penalty. Otherwise, the Penalty Time Clocks shall be the official timing device for all penalties that require a Team to play with less than five (5) Skaters. Players shall only be released from the Penalty Box when indicated by the Penalty Time Clock or as otherwise covered in the playing rules. The infraction of the rules for which each penalty has been imposed will be announced over the Public Address System as reported by the Referee. Where Players of both Teams are penalized at the same time, the penalty to the visiting Player will be announced first. In situations where multiple Game Misconduct Penalties have been assessed to any one (1) Player at the same stoppage of play, only one (1) Game Misconduct Penalty should be announced. Misconduct Penalties and coincident Major Penalties should not be recorded on the timing device (Penalty Time Clock) but such penalized Players should be alerted and released at the first stoppage of play following the expiration of their penalties. When a Player is assessed a Misconduct Penalty in addition to other penalties, the Misconduct Penalty shall only commence after all other penalties have been served (or washed out by the scoring of a goal). If a Player leaves the Penalty Box before the time has expired, the Penalty Timekeeper must note the time and notify the Referees at their first opportunity.

The Minor or Bench Minor Penalty which terminates automatically is the one with the least amount of time on the clock. Thus Coincident Minor Penalties to both Teams do not cause either side to be “short-handed” – see Rule 19 – Coincidental Penalties. If while a Team is “short-handed” by one or more Minor or Bench Minor Penalties, the opposing Team scores a goal, the first of such penalties shall automatically terminate. This rule shall also apply when a goal is awarded. This rule does not apply when a goal is scored on a “Penalty Shot” (i.e., offending Team’s penalized Player(s) do not get released on the scoring of a goal on a “Penalty Shot”). Minor Penalty expiration criteria: (I) Is the Team scored against “short-handed”? (II) Is the Team scored against serving a Minor Penalty on the clock? If both criteria are satisfied, the Minor Penalty with the least amount of time on the clock shall terminate except when “Coincidental Penalties” are being served. When the Minor Penalties of two Players of the same Team terminate at the same time, the Captain of that Team shall designate to the Referee which of such Players will return to the ice first and the Referee will instruct the Penalty Timekeeper accordingly.",

As there is a human factor involved in blowing the whistle to stop play, the Referee may deem the play to be stopped slightly prior to the whistle actually being blown. The fact that the puck may come loose or cross the Goal Line prior to the sound of the whistle has no bearing if the Referee has ruled that the play had been stopped prior to this happening. In the event of any dispute regarding time or the expiration of penalties, the matter shall be referred to the Referee for adjustment and their decision shall be final. They may use the Video Review Consultant to assist in rendering the final decision.

(III) Puck in the net prior to (or after) the expiration of time at the end of a period (IV) With the use of a foot/skate, a “distinct kicking motion” was evident (V) Puck deliberately directed, batted, or thrown into the net by an attacking Player by any means (and with any part of their body) other than with their stick – excl. foot/skate – see (IV) above.

When this occurs, if it is deemed to be done deliberately, then the decision shall be NO GOAL. A goal cannot be scored when the puck has been deliberately batted with any part of the attacking Player’s body into the net (Rule 78.4 – Scoring a Goal) (II) When the puck has been kicked using a distinct kicking motion (Rule 49.2 – Kicking) (III) When the puck has deflected directly into the net off an official (Rule 85.4 – Puck Striking Official) (IV) When a goal has been scored and an ineligible Player is on the ice (Rule 68.5 – Disallowed Goal) (V) When an attacking Player has interfered with a Goalkeeper in their Goal Crease (Rule 69.1 – Interference on the Goalkeeper) (VI) When the puck has entered the net after making contact with an attacking Player’s stick that is above the height of the crossbar. Where the puck makes contact with the stick is the determining factor (Rule 80.3 – Disallowed Goal) (VII) When Video Review confirms the scoring of a goal at one end of the ice, any goal scored at the other end on the same play must be disallowed (Rule 37.2 – Video Review) (VIII) When a Linesperson reports a Double-minor Penalty for high-sticking or a Major Penalty to the Referee following the scoring of a goal by the offending Team, the goal must be disallowed, and the appropriate penalty assessed (Rule 32.4 – Reporting to Referee) (IX) When a Goalkeeper has been pushed into the net together with the puck after making a save (Rule 69.7 – Rebounds and Loose Pucks) (X) When the net becomes displaced accidentally. The goal frame is considered to be displaced if either or both goal pegs are no longer in their respective holes in the ice, or the net has come completely off one or both pegs, prior to or as the puck enters the goal. However, if this occurs as a result of the actions of a defending player, refer to (Rule 63.7 – Awarded Goal) (XI) During the delayed calling of a penalty, the offending Team cannot score unless the non-offending Team shoots the puck into their own net. This shall mean that a deflection off an offending Player or any physical action by an offending Player that may cause the puck to enter the non-offending Team’s goal, shall not be considered a legal goal. Play shall be stopped before the puck enters the net (whenever possible) and the signaled penalty assessed to the offending Team; (XII) When the Referee deems the play has been stopped, even if they have not physically had the opportunity to stop play by blowing their whistle; (XIII) Any goal scored, other than as covered by the official rules, shall not be allowed.",

In case of an obvious error in awarding a goal or an assist that has been announced, it should be corrected promptly, but changes should not be made in the official scoring summary after the Referee has signed the game report. The Team scoring the greatest number of goals during the three (3) twenty-minute periods shall be the winner and shall be credited with three (3) points in the standings. In the event a winner during the Round Robin or Preliminary Round is determined in the Overtime period or the shootout, the winning Team shall be credited with two (2) points in the standings and the losing Team will be credited with one (1) point in the standings. A “goal” shall be credited in the scoring records to a Player who shall have propelled the puck into the opponent’s goal. Each “goal” shall count one point in the Player’s record. Only one point can be credited to any one Player on a goal. When a Player scores a goal, an “assist” shall be credited to the Player or Players (maximum two) who touch the puck prior to the “goal scorer” provided no defender plays or has “control of the puck” subsequently. Each “assist” shall count one point in the Player’s record. Only one point can be credited to any one Player on a goal. A goal shall be scored when the puck shall have been put between the Goal Posts by the stick of a Player of the attacking side, from in front and below the crossbar, and entirely across a red line the width of the diameter of the Goal Posts drawn on the ice from one Goal Post to the other with the goal frame in its proper position. The goal frame shall be considered in its proper position when at least a portion of the flexible peg(s) are still inside both the Goal post and the hole in the ice. The flexible pegs could be bent, but as long as at least a portion of the flexible peg(s) are still in the hole in the ice and the Goal Post, the goal frame shall be deemed to be in its proper position. The goal frame could be raised somewhat on one post (or both), but as long as the flexible pegs are still in contact with the holes in the ice and the Goal Posts, the goal frame shall not be deemed to be displaced. A goal shall be scored if the puck is shot into the goal by a Player of the defending side. The Player of the attacking side who last touched the puck shall be credited with the goal, but no assist shall be awarded. A goal shall be scored if the puck is put into the goal in any other manner by a Player of the defending side. The Player of the attacking side who last touched the puck shall be credited with the goal and assists may be awarded. If an attacking Player has the puck deflect into the net, off their skate or body, in any manner, the goal shall be allowed. The Player who deflected the puck shall be credited with the goal. Should a Player legally propel a puck into the Goal Crease of the opponent Team and the puck should become loose and available to another Player of the attacking side, a goal scored on the play shall be legal. Apparent goals shall be disallowed by the Referee and the appropriate announcement made by the Public Address Announcer for the following reasons: (I) When the puck has been directed with any part of their body (excl. skates), batted or thrown into the net by an attacking Player other than with a stick. When this occurs, if it is deemed to be done deliberately, then the decision shall be NO GOAL. A goal cannot be scored when the puck has been deliberately batted with any part of the attacking Player’s body into the net (Rule 78.4 – Scoring a Goal) (II) When the puck has been kicked using a distinct kicking motion (Rule 49.2 – Kicking) (III) When the puck has deflected directly into the net off an official (Rule 85.4 – Puck Striking Official) (IV) When a goal has been scored and an ineligible Player is on the ice (Rule 68.5 – Disallowed Goal) (V) When an attacking Player has interfered with a Goalkeeper in their Goal Crease (Rule 69.1 – Interference on the Goalkeeper) (VI) When the puck has entered the net after making contact with an attacking Player’s stick that is above the height of the crossbar. Where the puck makes contact with the stick is the determining factor (Rule 80.3 – Disallowed Goal) (VII) When Video Review confirms the scoring of a goal at one end of the ice, any goal scored at the other end on the same play must be disallowed (Rule 37.2 – Video Review) (VIII) When a Linesperson reports a Double-minor Penalty for high-sticking or a Major Penalty to the Referee following the scoring of a goal by the offending Team, the goal must be disallowed, and the appropriate penalty assessed (Rule 32.4 – Reporting to Referee) (IX) When a Goalkeeper has been pushed into the net together with the puck after making a save (Rule 69.7 – Rebounds and Loose Pucks) (X) When the net becomes displaced accidentally. The goal frame is considered to be displaced if either or both goal pegs are no longer in their respective holes in the ice, or the net has come completely off one or both pegs, prior to or as the puck enters the goal. However, if this occurs as a result of the actions of a defending player, refer to (Rule 63.7 – Awarded Goal) (XI) During the delayed calling of a penalty, the offending Team cannot score unless the non-offending Team shoots the puck into their own net. This shall mean that a deflection off an offending Player or any physical action by an offending Player that may cause the puck to enter the non-offending Team’s goal, shall not be considered a legal goal. Play shall be stopped before the puck enters the net (whenever possible) and the signaled penalty assessed to the offending Team; (XII) When the Referee deems the play has been stopped, even if they have not physically had the opportunity to stop play by blowing their whistle; (XIII) Any goal scored, other than as covered by the official rules, shall not be allowed.",

When the Linesperson signals a “Delayed Off-side” and a defending Player shoots the puck which goes over the Protection Glass and out of play, the ensuing “face-off” shall be conducted at one of the Defending Zone End Zone Face-off Spots and the defending Player would be assessed a Minor Penalty. (Rule 63 – Delaying the Game) When the Linesperson signals a “Delayed Off-side” and the original shot deflects off a defending Player and out of play, the ensuing “face-off” shall take place at the nearest Face-off Spot in the zone from where the puck was shot.

(III) If the defending Player is pressured or about to be checked by an attacking Player – nearest Face-off Spot in the zone from which the pass or shot originated that gives the offending Team the least amount of “territorial advantage” (even if deflected off an attacking or defending Player or an official). (IV) If deemed to be an “intentional off-side” – Face-off Spot in the offending Team’s End Zone. When the Linesperson signals a “Delayed Off-side” and a defending Player shoots the puck which goes over the Protection Glass and out of play, the ensuing “face-off” shall be conducted at one of the Defending Zone End Zone Face-off Spots and the defending Player would be assessed a Minor Penalty. (Rule 63 – Delaying the Game) When the Linesperson signals a “Delayed Off-side” and the original shot deflects off a defending Player and out of play, the ensuing “face-off” shall take place at the nearest Face-off Spot in the zone from where the puck was shot. When the defending Team is about to be penalized in the Defending Zone and the Linesperson has a “Delayed Off-side” signaled against the attacking Team on the same play, the ensuing “face-off” shall be conducted at one of the Defending Zone End Zone Face-off Spots.",

For violations related to “closing their hand on the puck”, refer to Handling Puck: (Rule 67 – Handling Puck) Play will not be stopped for any hand pass by Players in their own Defending Zone. The location of the puck when contacted by either the Player making the hand pass or the Player receiving the hand pass shall determine the zone it is in. When a hand pass violation has occurred, the ensuing “face-off” shall take place at the nearest Face-off Spot in the zone where the offense occurred, unless the offending Team gains a territorial advantage, then the “face-off” shall be at the nearest Face-off Spot in the zone where the stoppage of play occurred, unless otherwise covered in the rules. When a hand pass violation occurs by a Team in their Attacking Zone, the ensuing “face-off” shall be conducted at one of the Face-off Spots outside the defending Team’s Blue Line in the Neutral Zone. Batting the puck above the normal height of the shoulders with a stick is prohibited. When a puck is struck with a “high stick” and subsequently comes into the “possession and control” of a Player from the offending Team (including the Player who made contact with the puck), either directly or deflected off any Player or official, there shall be a whistle. When a puck has been contacted by a “high stick”, the play shall be permitted to continue, provided that: (I) The puck has been batted to an opponent (when a Player bats the puck to an opponent, the Referee shall give the “washout” signal immediately – otherwise, they will stop the play). (II) A Player of the defending side shall bat the puck into their own goal in which case the goal shall be allowed. Cradling the puck on the blade of the stick (“lacrosse style”) above the normal height of the shoulders shall be prohibited and a stoppage of play shall result. If this is done by a Player on a “Penalty Shot” or Shootout attempt, the shot shall be stopped immediately and considered complete. (Rule 60 – High-sticking) When the play is stopped for the “high-sticking the puck” violation, the ensuing “face-off” must take place at the spot that provides the least amount of “territorial advantage” to the Team striking the puck, either where the puck was contacted illegally, or where it was last played by the offending Team. If the attacking Team is at fault and the play is stopped while the puck is in the Attacking Zone, the ensuing “face-off” must be moved to the nearest Face-off Spot in the Neutral Zone. When an attacking Player causes the puck to enter the opponent’s goal by contacting the puck above the height of the crossbar, either directly or deflected off any Player or official, the goal shall not be allowed. The determining factor is where the puck makes contact with the stick. If the puck makes contact with the stick at or below the level of the crossbar and enters the goal, this goal shall be allowed. A goal scored as a result of a defending Player striking the puck with their stick carried above the height of the crossbar of the goal frame into their own goal shall be allowed. When a puck goes outside the playing area at either end or either side of the Rink, strikes any obstacles above the playing surface other than the Boards or Protective Glass, causes the glass, lighting, timing device or the supports to break, it shall be “faced-off” at the nearest Face-off Spot in the zone from where it was shot or deflected out of play. Should the On-ice Officials rule that the shot or deflection that caused the puck to go out of play originated from the neutral or Defending Zones, the resulting “face-off” location shall be the nearest Face-off Spot closest to the origin of the shot or deflection that gives the offending Team the least amount of “territorial advantage”. If the puck comes to rest on top of the Boards surrounding the playing area, it shall be considered to be in play and may be played legally by hand or stick. When the puck goes outside the playing area directly off the “face-off”, regardless as to which Player may have last contacted the puck, the “face-off” shall remain in the same spot and no penalty will be assessed to either Team for delaying the game. When the puck is shot and it makes contact with the gloves or the body of a Player hanging over the Players’ Bench, or if the puck enters the Players’ Bench through an open bench door, the “face-off” shall take place at the nearest Face-off Spot in the zone from where the puck was shot, however, if the puck hits an opposing Player’s glove or body that is hanging over the opposing Team’s Players’ Bench or enters the opposing Team’s Players’ Bench through an open bench door, the “face-off” shall take place in the Neutral Zone adjacent to the opponent’s Players’ Bench. Should the puck strike the curved glass located at the end of either Players’ Bench, play shall be stopped when observed by any of the On-ice Officials. The ensuing “face-off” shall be determined as if the puck went outside the playing area. Should the puck strike the spectator netting at the ends and the corners of the arena, play shall be stopped, and the ensuing “faceoff” shall be determined as if the puck went outside the playing area. Players must not stop playing the game until they hear the whistle to do so. When the puck becomes lodged in the netting on the outside of either goal so as to make it “unplayable”, or if it is “frozen” between opposing Players intentionally or otherwise, the Referee shall stop the play. The puck may be played off the goal netting by either Team. However, should the puck remain on the goal netting for more than three (3) seconds, play shall be stopped. Should the Goalkeeper use their stick or glove to “freeze” the puck on the back of the net or should a defending Player shield an attacking Player from playing the puck off the back of the net, the “face-off” shall take place at one of the Face-off Spots in the Defending Zone. Should the puck go under the goal either from behind or the side, or through the mesh from behind or the side, if this is witnessed by an On-ice Official, play should be stopped immediately, and the ensuing “face-off” should take place at the nearest Face-off Spot in the zone nearest to the location where the play was stopped. Should a scramble take place, or a Player accidentally fall on the puck and the puck be out of sight of the Referee, they shall immediately blow their whistle and stop the play. The puck shall then be “faced-off” at the nearest Face-off Spot in the zone where the play was stopped unless otherwise provided for in the rules. Play shall not be stopped if the puck touches an On-ice Official anywhere on the Rink, regardless of whether a Team is “short-handed” or not. A puck that deflects back into the Defending Zone off an On-ice Official who is in the Neutral Zone, will be deemed to be “off-side”. (Rule 83 – Off-side) The puck striking or deflecting off an On-ice Official does not automatically nullify a “potential icing”. When a puck deflects off an On-ice Official and goes out of play, the ensuing “face-off” will take place at the Face-off Spot in the zone nearest to where the puck deflected off the Official. If a goal is scored as a result of being deflected directly into the net off an On-ice Official, the goal shall not be allowed. Should any Player cause the puck to go out of play or become “unplayable” in any zone, the “face-off” shall take place at the Face-off Spot in the zone from which the puck was shot. If deflected out of play, at the nearest Face-off Spot in the zone where it deflected out of play. If this stoppage is caused by an attacking player in the attacking zone, the face-off will take place at the closest face-off spot in the attacking zone (if the player did not make an infraction as per (Rule 63 – delaying the game)) If the zone happens to be the Neutral Zone, the Face-off Spot selected shall be the one that gives the offending Team the least amount of “territorial advantage”. For a puck that is “unplayable” due to being lodged in the netting or as a result of it being “frozen” between opposing Players, the resulting “face-off” shall be at either of the adjacent Face-off Spots or at the nearest Face-off Spot in the zone from which the puck was shot, unless otherwise covered in these rules. If the attacking Team shoots the puck into the zone and a “Delayed Off-side” is indicated, or if the attacking Team commits a game flow infraction such as contacting the puck with a “high-stick” or “batting the puck with a glove” (causing a stoppage of play), the ensuing “face-off” shall be in the Neutral Zone outside the offending Team’s Attacking Zone. A Minor Penalty for “Delay of Game” shall be imposed on a Goalkeeper who “deliberately” drops the puck on the goal netting to cause a stoppage of play. (Rule 67.3 – Handling the Puck) Any loss of time on the game or penalty clocks due to the puck going out of play must be replaced. The Video Goal Consultant may be consulted to ensure the time is accurately replaced. (Rule 37.6 – Video Review to verify time on clock)",

The one exception to this provision is when the puck is played out from the playing area by either team and goes unnoticed by the on-ice officials; (III) Scoring Plays Involving Potential “Interference on the Goalkeeper” Either: (1) A play that results in a “goal” call on the ice where the defending Team claims that the goal should have been disallowed due to “Interference on the Goalkeeper” (Rule 69 – Interference on the Goalkeeper;) or (2) A play that results in a “no goal” call on the ice despite the puck having entered the net, where the On-ice Officials have determined that the attacking Team was guilty of “Interference on the Goalkeeper” but where the attacking Team claims: • There was no actual contact of any kind initiated by an attacking Player with the Goalkeeper; • The attacking Player was pushed, shoved or fouled by a defending Player which caused the attacking Player to come into contact with the Goalkeeper; or • The attacking Player’s positioning within the Goal Crease did not impair the Goalkeeper’s ability to defend their goal and, in fact, had no discernable impact on the play.The standard for overturning the call in the event of a “goal” call on the ice is that the On-ice Officials (Referees), after reviewing any and all available replays and consulting with the Video Review Consultant determine that the play should have been stopped for a event caused by the attacking team, but was not at some point after the puck entered the Attacking Zone but prior to the goal being scored; where this standard is met, the goal will be disallowed.

In all Coach’s Challenge situations, the original call on the ice will be overturned if, and only if, a conclusive and irrefutable determination can be made on the basis of video evidence that the original call on the ice was clearly not correct. If a review is not conclusive and/or there is any doubt whatsoever as to whether the call on the ice was correct, the original call on the ice will be confirmed.

All Coach’s Challenges must be initiated by notice verbally communicated to a Referee prior to the Center ice “face-off” following a “goal” or, in the case of a “no goal” call by reason of “Interference on the Goalkeeper,” prior to the resumption of play. Teams may not unduly delay the resumption of play while evaluating whether or not to initiate a Coach’s Challenge. Any such delay or delay tactics may result in the denial of a right to Challenge and, at the discretion of the Referee, may also result in a Bench Minor Penalty for “Delaying the Game”. (Rule 63 – Delaying the Game) In order to expedite the review process, Coaches initiating a Coach’s Challenge are required to provide to the Referee, with reasonable specificity, both the reason for their Coach’s Challenge (i.e., the actual infraction that is being claimed) and the approximate time on the clock when the purported infraction transpired. Failure to provide this information with reasonable specificity may result in the denial of a right to a Coach’s Challenge. Only one Coach’s Challenge per Team per stoppage will be permitted. The IIHF Technology Department in cooperation with the Organizer will make available in all arenas suitable technology (for example, a handheld tablet or a television or computer monitor) that will allow the On-ice Officials, in conjunction with the Video Review Consultant, to review video replays of the play giving rise to the Coach’s Challenge. To the extent practical and possible, the replays made available to the On-ice Officials will be the same replays that are being utilized by the Video Review Consultant. Once a Coach’s Challenge has been initiated, the Video Review Consultant will immediately establish contact with the On-ice Official(s) responsible for the call (or non-call) on the ice via the headset and will inquire and discuss with the On-ice Official(s), prior to the On-ice Official reviewing any video, the following: (I) the On-ice Official’s “final call on the ice”; and (II) what the On-ice Official(s) observed on the play. The Video Review Consultant will be involved both in communicating with the On-ice Officials via the headset and with providing input to the On-ice Officials (Referees and Linespersons). The On-ice Officials are responsible for making the “final” decision. The “on-ice call” will then be reviewed simultaneously by the appropriate On-ice Official(s) at ice level and by the Video Review Consultant using any and all replays at their disposal. After their joint review and consultation, the On-ice Officials (Referees or Linespersons) will render the decision on whether to uphold or overturn the original “call on the ice”. Once a decision is made, the Referee will inform the Penalty Timekeeper/Public Address Announcer and will make the announcement on the ice. Teams may initiate a Coach’s Challenge on appropriate plays at any time during the game. In cases where a Challenge has been initiated for an “Off-side-Play Leading to a Goal” or a “Missed Game Stoppage Event in the Offensive Zone Leading to a Goal”, and a determination is made that the GOAL call on the ice should be overturned, the goal will be disallowed and the clock will be re-set to the time at which the play should have been stopped for the missed infraction. In such cases, a “face-off” will ensue in the ice location where it would have otherwise occurred had the on-ice infraction been called properly. If one or more penalties (Minor or Major) are assessed between the time of the missed infraction and the Video Review that disallows the apparent goal, the offending Team(s) (and responsible Player(s)) will still be required to serve the penalty(ies) identified and assessed, and the time of the penalty(ies) will be recorded as the time at which the play should have been stopped for the missed infraction. In cases where a Challenge has been initiated for a “goal” call on the ice where the defending Team claims that the goal should have been disallowed due to the “Interference on the Goalkeeper,” as described in (Rule 69 – Interference on the Goalkeeper) and a determination is made that the “call on the ice” should be overturned, the goal will be disallowed, and a “face-off” will ensue in the nearest Neutral Zone Face-off Spot outside the Attacking Zone. The Video Review process on these plays will be utilized exclusively for purposes of overturning a “goal” call on the ice – it will not be utilized for any other purpose, including, specifically, for assessing Minor or Major Penalties for Goalkeeper Interference. In cases where a Challenge has been initiated for a “no goal” call on the ice despite the puck having entered the net, where the On-ice Officials have determined that the attacking Team was guilty of “Interference on the Goalkeeper,” and a determination is made that the “call on the ice” should be overturned, the goal will be allowed an  a “face-off” will ensue at Center ice. (Rule 69 – Interference on the Goalkeeper) If a penalty for “Interference on a Goalkeeper” was indicated and based on the Video Review, no such action was committed by the attacking Player, no penalty shall be assessed for such an infraction. All other penalties not related to “Interference on a Goalkeeper” should be assessed and served in a normal manner. On the other hand, penalties not indicated cannot be assessed due to the Video Review. If a Team initiates a Coach’s Challenge for any of the enumerated scenarios in Rule 38.2 above and such Challenge does not result in the “final call on the ice” being overturned, the Team exercising such Challenge shall be assessed a Bench Minor Penalty (2 minutes) for Delaying the Game. If a Team that has already initiated one or more Coach’s Challenges that were unsuccessful, initiates a Coach’s Challenge for any of the enumerated scenarios in Rule 38.2 above and such Challenge does not result in the original call on the ice being overturned, the Team exercising such a Coach’s Challenge shall be assessed a Double-Bench Minor Penalty (4 minutes) for Delaying the Game. Note: If a situation cannot be reviewed by the on-ice officials due to a technical error (e.g. a \"black screen\"), the \"final call on the ice\" will stand. In this case, the Coach's Challenge will be considered “unsuccessful” but no Bench Minor Penalty will be assessed on the team that initiated the challenge The standard for overturning the call in the event of a “goal” call on the ice is that the On-ice Officials (Linespersons), after reviewing any and all available replays and consulting with the Video Review Consultant, determine that one or more Players on the attacking Team preceded the puck into the Attacking Zone prior to the goal being scored and that, as a result, the play should have been stopped for an “Off-side” infraction; where this standard is met, the goal will be disallowed. Goals will only be subject to review for a potential “Off-side” infraction if the puck does not come out of the Attacking Zone again between the time of the “Off-side” infraction and the time the goal is scored. The standard for overturning the call in the event of a “goal” call on the ice is that the On-ice Officials (Referees), after reviewing any and all available replays and consulting with the Video Review Consultant determine that the play should have been stopped for a event caused by the attacking team, but was not at some point after the puck entered the Attacking Zone but prior to the goal being scored; where this standard is met, the goal will be disallowed. Potential infractions that would require a play stoppage in the Attacking Zone by the attacking team, includes but may not be limited to: (Rule 79 – Hand Pass;) (Rule 80 – High-sticking the Puck; and) (Rule 85 – Puck Out of Bounds) . Such infractions will only serve as a basis for overturning a “goal” call on the ice if Video Review can conclusively establish that a game stoppage event had occurred in the Attacking Zone and was missed by the On-ice Official(s). Where the infraction at issue was a missed penalty call subject to the judgment or discretion of the On-ice Official(s), such infraction cannot result in the “goal” call on the ice being overturned, even if upon review, the On-ice Official(s) would have made a different call. Goals will only be reviewed for a potential “Missed Game Stoppage Event in the Attacking Zone” if the puck does not come out of the Attacking Zone again between the time of the “Missed Game Stoppage Event in the Attacking Zone” and the time the goal is scored. The standard for overturning the call in the event of a “goal” call on the ice is that the On-ice Officials (Referees), after reviewing any and all replays and consulting with the Video Review Consultant, determine that the goal should have been disallowed due to “Interference on the Goalkeeper,” as described in (Rule 69 – – Interference on the Goalkeeper;) where this standard is met, the goal will be disallowed. The standard for overturning the call in the event of a “no goal” call on the ice is that the On-ice Officials (Referees), after reviewing any and all replays and consulting with the Video Review Consultant, determine that the goal on the ice should have been allowed because either: (I) There was no actual contact of any kind initiated by the attacking Player with the Goalkeeper; or (II) The attacking Player was pushed, shoved or fouled by the defending Player causing the attacking Player to come into contact with the Goalkeeper; or (III) The attacking Player’s positioning within the Goal Crease did not impair the Goalkeeper’s ability to defend their goal and, in fact, had no discernable impact on the play; where this standard is met, the goal will be allowed.A Team may only request a Coach’s Challenge to review the following scenarios: (I) “Off-side”-Play Leading to a Goal A play that results in a “goal” call on the ice where the defending Team claims that the play should have been stopped by reason of an “Off-side” infraction by the attacking Team. (Rule 83 – Off-side) (II) Missed Game Stoppage Event in the Attacking Zone Leading to a Goal A play that results in a “goal” call on the ice where the defending Team claims that the play should have been stopped by reason of any play occurring in the Attacking Zone that should have resulted in a play stoppage caused by the attacking Team but did not. The one exception to this provision is when the puck is played out from the playing area by either team and goes unnoticed by the on-ice officials; (III) Scoring Plays Involving Potential “Interference on the Goalkeeper” Either: (1) A play that results in a “goal” call on the ice where the defending Team claims that the goal should have been disallowed due to “Interference on the Goalkeeper” (Rule 69 – Interference on the Goalkeeper;) or (2) A play that results in a “no goal” call on the ice despite the puck having entered the net, where the On-ice Officials have determined that the attacking Team was guilty of “Interference on the Goalkeeper” but where the attacking Team claims: • There was no actual contact of any kind initiated by an attacking Player with the Goalkeeper; • The attacking Player was pushed, shoved or fouled by a defending Player which caused the attacking Player to come into contact with the Goalkeeper; or • The attacking Player’s positioning within the Goal Crease did not impair the Goalkeeper’s ability to defend their goal and, in fact, had no discernable impact on the play.",

In all Coach’s Challenge situations, the original call on the ice will be overturned if, and only if, a conclusive and irrefutable determination can be made on the basis of video evidence that the original call on the ice was clearly not correct. If a review is not conclusive and/or there is any doubt whatsoever as to whether the call on the ice was correct, the original call on the ice will be confirmed. ( » For more information refer to IIHF Technology Codes & Regulations.) A Team may only request a Coach’s Challenge to review the following scenarios: (I) “Off-side”-Play Leading to a Goal A play that results in a “goal” call on the ice where the defending Team claims that the play should have been stopped by reason of an “Off-side” infraction by the attacking Team. (Rule 83 – Off-side) (II) Missed Game Stoppage Event in the Attacking Zone Leading to a Goal A play that results in a “goal” call on the ice where the defending Team claims that the play should have been stopped by reason of any play occurring in the Attacking Zone that should have resulted in a play stoppage caused by the attacking Team but did not. The one exception to this provision is when the puck is played out from the playing area by either team and goes unnoticed by the on-ice officials; (III) Scoring Plays Involving Potential “Interference on the Goalkeeper” Either: (1) A play that results in a “goal” call on the ice where the defending Team claims that the goal should have been disallowed due to “Interference on the Goalkeeper” (Rule 69 – Interference on the Goalkeeper;) or (2) A play that results in a “no goal” call on the ice despite the puck having entered the net, where the On-ice Officials have determined that the attacking Team was guilty of “Interference on the Goalkeeper” but where the attacking Team claims: • There was no actual contact of any kind initiated by an attacking Player with the Goalkeeper; • The attacking Player was pushed, shoved or fouled by a defending Player which caused the attacking Player to come into contact with the Goalkeeper; or • The attacking Player’s positioning within the Goal Crease did not impair the Goalkeeper’s ability to defend their goal and, in fact, had no discernable impact on the play. All Coach’s Challenges must be initiated by notice verbally communicated to a Referee prior to the Center ice “face-off” following a “goal” or, in the case of a “no goal” call by reason of “Interference on the Goalkeeper,” prior to the resumption of play. Teams may not unduly delay the resumption of play while evaluating whether or not to initiate a Coach’s Challenge. Any such delay or delay tactics may result in the denial of a right to Challenge and, at the discretion of the Referee, may also result in a Bench Minor Penalty for “Delaying the Game”. (Rule 63 – Delaying the Game) In order to expedite the review process, Coaches initiating a Coach’s Challenge are required to provide to the Referee, with reasonable specificity, both the reason for their Coach’s Challenge (i.e., the actual infraction that is being claimed) and the approximate time on the clock when the purported infraction transpired. Failure to provide this information with reasonable specificity may result in the denial of a right to a Coach’s Challenge. Only one Coach’s Challenge per Team per stoppage will be permitted. The IIHF Technology Department in cooperation with the Organizer will make available in all arenas suitable technology (for example, a handheld tablet or a television or computer monitor) that will allow the On-ice Officials, in conjunction with the Video Review Consultant, to review video replays of the play giving rise to the Coach’s Challenge. To the extent practical and possible, the replays made available to the On-ice Officials will be the same replays that are being utilized by the Video Review Consultant. Once a Coach’s Challenge has been initiated, the Video Review Consultant will immediately establish contact with the On-ice Official(s) responsible for the call (or non-call) on the ice via the headset and will inquire and discuss with the On-ice Official(s), prior to the On-ice Official reviewing any video, the following: (I) the On-ice Official’s “final call on the ice”; and (II) what the On-ice Official(s) observed on the play. The Video Review Consultant will be involved both in communicating with the On-ice Officials via the headset and with providing input to the On-ice Officials (Referees and Linespersons). The On-ice Officials are responsible for making the “final” decision. The “on-ice call” will then be reviewed simultaneously by the appropriate On-ice Official(s) at ice level and by the Video Review Consultant using any and all replays at their disposal. After their joint review and consultation, the On-ice Officials (Referees or Linespersons) will render the decision on whether to uphold or overturn the original “call on the ice”. Once a decision is made, the Referee will inform the Penalty Timekeeper/Public Address Announcer and will make the announcement on the ice. Teams may initiate a Coach’s Challenge on appropriate plays at any time during the game. In cases where a Challenge has been initiated for an “Off-side-Play Leading to a Goal” or a “Missed Game Stoppage Event in the Offensive Zone Leading to a Goal”, and a determination is made that the GOAL call on the ice should be overturned, the goal will be disallowed and the clock will be re-set to the time at which the play should have been stopped for the missed infraction. In such cases, a “face-off” will ensue in the ice location where it would have otherwise occurred had the on-ice infraction been called properly. If one or more penalties (Minor or Major) are assessed between the time of the missed infraction and the Video Review that disallows the apparent goal, the offending Team(s) (and responsible Player(s)) will still be required to serve the penalty(ies) identified and assessed, and the time of the penalty(ies) will be recorded as the time at which the play should have been stopped for the missed infraction. In cases where a Challenge has been initiated for a “goal” call on the ice where the defending Team claims that the goal should have been disallowed due to the “Interference on the Goalkeeper,” as described in (Rule 69 – Interference on the Goalkeeper) and a determination is made that the “call on the ice” should be overturned, the goal will be disallowed, and a “face-off” will ensue in the nearest Neutral Zone Face-off Spot outside the Attacking Zone. The Video Review process on these plays will be utilized exclusively for purposes of overturning a “goal” call on the ice – it will not be utilized for any other purpose, including, specifically, for assessing Minor or Major Penalties for Goalkeeper Interference. In cases where a Challenge has been initiated for a “no goal” call on the ice despite the puck having entered the net, where the On-ice Officials have determined that the attacking Team was guilty of “Interference on the Goalkeeper,” and a determination is made that the “call on the ice” should be overturned, the goal will be allowed an  a “face-off” will ensue at Center ice. (Rule 69 – Interference on the Goalkeeper) If a penalty for “Interference on a Goalkeeper” was indicated and based on the Video Review, no such action was committed by the attacking Player, no penalty shall be assessed for such an infraction. All other penalties not related to “Interference on a Goalkeeper” should be assessed and served in a normal manner. On the other hand, penalties not indicated cannot be assessed due to the Video Review. If a Team initiates a Coach’s Challenge for any of the enumerated scenarios in Rule 38.2 above and such Challenge does not result in the “final call on the ice” being overturned, the Team exercising such Challenge shall be assessed a Bench Minor Penalty (2 minutes) for Delaying the Game. If a Team that has already initiated one or more Coach’s Challenges that were unsuccessful, initiates a Coach’s Challenge for any of the enumerated scenarios in Rule 38.2 above and such Challenge does not result in the original call on the ice being overturned, the Team exercising such a Coach’s Challenge shall be assessed a Double-Bench Minor Penalty (4 minutes) for Delaying the Game. Note: If a situation cannot be reviewed by the on-ice officials due to a technical error (e.g. a \"black screen\"), the \"final call on the ice\" will stand. In this case, the Coach's Challenge will be considered “unsuccessful” but no Bench Minor Penalty will be assessed on the team that initiated the challenge The standard for overturning the call in the event of a “goal” call on the ice is that the On-ice Officials (Linespersons), after reviewing any and all available replays and consulting with the Video Review Consultant, determine that one or more Players on the attacking Team preceded the puck into the Attacking Zone prior to the goal being scored and that, as a result, the play should have been stopped for an “Off-side” infraction; where this standard is met, the goal will be disallowed. Goals will only be subject to review for a potential “Off-side” infraction if the puck does not come out of the Attacking Zone again between the time of the “Off-side” infraction and the time the goal is scored. The standard for overturning the call in the event of a “goal” call on the ice is that the On-ice Officials (Referees), after reviewing any and all available replays and consulting with the Video Review Consultant determine that the play should have been stopped for a event caused by the attacking team, but was not at some point after the puck entered the Attacking Zone but prior to the goal being scored; where this standard is met, the goal will be disallowed. Potential infractions that would require a play stoppage in the Attacking Zone by the attacking team, includes but may not be limited to: (Rule 79 – Hand Pass;) (Rule 80 – High-sticking the Puck; and) (Rule 85 – Puck Out of Bounds) . Such infractions will only serve as a basis for overturning a “goal” call on the ice if Video Review can conclusively establish that a game stoppage event had occurred in the Attacking Zone and was missed by the On-ice Official(s). Where the infraction at issue was a missed penalty call subject to the judgment or discretion of the On-ice Official(s), such infraction cannot result in the “goal” call on the ice being overturned, even if upon review, the On-ice Official(s) would have made a different call. Goals will only be reviewed for a potential “Missed Game Stoppage Event in the Attacking Zone” if the puck does not come out of the Attacking Zone again between the time of the “Missed Game Stoppage Event in the Attacking Zone” and the time the goal is scored. The standard for overturning the call in the event of a “goal” call on the ice is that the On-ice Officials (Referees), after reviewing any and all replays and consulting with the Video Review Consultant, determine that the goal should have been disallowed due to “Interference on the Goalkeeper,” as described in (Rule 69 – – Interference on the Goalkeeper;) where this standard is met, the goal will be disallowed. The standard for overturning the call in the event of a “no goal” call on the ice is that the On-ice Officials (Referees), after reviewing any and all replays and consulting with the Video Review Consultant, determine that the goal on the ice should have been allowed because either: (I) There was no actual contact of any kind initiated by the attacking Player with the Goalkeeper; or (II) The attacking Player was pushed, shoved or fouled by the defending Player causing the attacking Player to come into contact with the Goalkeeper; or (III) The attacking Player’s positioning within the Goal Crease did not impair the Goalkeeper’s ability to defend their goal and, in fact, had no discernable impact on the play; where this standard is met, the goal will be allowed. Each Team shall be permitted to take one thirty-second (30 s) “time-out” during the course of any game. All Players including Goalkeepers on the ice at the time of the “time-out” will be allowed to go to their respective benches. This “time-out” must be taken during a normal stoppage of play. Only one “time-out” (\"television commercial break / power break\" or Team “time-out”), shall be permitted at any one stoppage of play. For the purpose of this rule, a “television commercial break” is deemed an “official time-out” and not charged to either Team. Any Player designated by the Coach or the Coach will indicate to the Referee that their Team is exercising its option. The “time-out” must be requested by the team before the Referee has completed the players change procedure, before the Referee lowers his hand and points to the respecting face-off location. The Referee will report the “time-out” to the Game Timekeeper who shall be responsible for signaling the termination of the “time-out”. No “time-out” shall be granted following a “face-off” violation. No “time-out” shall be granted to the defensive Team following an icing, following the Goalkeeper causing a stoppage of play from a shoot-in from beyond the center red line, or when a defending Player accidentally dislodges the net causing a stoppage of play. No “time-out” shall be granted when a “Penalty Shot” has been awarded to either Team by the Referee, once instructions have been given to the Player taking the shot and the Goalkeeper defending the shot. No “time-out” will be granted during the shootout. No warm-up involving pucks on the ice shall be permitted for a Goalkeeper or replacement Goalkeeper during a “time-out”. If, after one warning, this continues, the Referee shall assess a “Delay of Game” penalty to the offending Team. During each regular period of the games in an IIHF Championship there shall be a maximum of three (3) commercial breaks, each with a maximum duration of seventy (70) seconds but can be subject to change for specific events. Commercial breaks shall be taken at the first stoppage of play after the following times on the game clock as it counts down: (I) Break number 1: 14.00 (min.) (II) Break number 2: 10.00 (min.) (III) Break number 3: 06.00 (min.) Despite the above indicated time slots, commercial breaks shall not be taken if: a) A goal is scored; b) A penalty shot is called; c) One of the Teams is playing short-handed; d) A fight breaks out on ice; e) An icing infraction is called; f) The net is dislodged accidentally by a defending player (incl. goalkeeper); and g) The puck is shot into the end zone from beyond the center red line and the goalkeeper freezes the puck resulting in a stoppage of play. Exceptions from point e-g above is when a penalty or penalties are assessed in the stoppage that affects the on-ice strength of either team. In the event that a commercial break is not taken during the time slot prescribed above, because of the exceptions above, the missed commercial opportunity shall be made up at the first stoppage of play in the next commercial break time slot. If there is another incident where the second commercial break is missed, this procedure shall continue to repeat itself until all commercial breaks are taken. However, there must always be at least 60 seconds between two commercial breaks. Any extra commercial break taken during a time slot shall follow the procedure described above and they shall be eliminated from the last remaining time slot of that period. They shall not be used to create extra commercial inventory for broadcasters. However, in such instances, the Commercial Coordinator will be instructed to turn on the light and signal the truck that an optional commercial opportunity is being taken. No commercial breaks shall be taken in the final thirty (30) seconds of the first and second periods, as well as during the final two (2) minutes of the third period. No commercial breaks shall be granted during overtime. The Teams shall comply with the following provisions during commercial breaks: a) Goalkeepers will be allowed to go to their respective players’ bench. b) Teams are allowed to change lines once the referee blows the whistle signaling the teams to return to the face-off with 20 seconds remaining in the commercial stoppage. c) These line changes will follow the same protocol as a normal line change during a stoppage of play. Immediately after a goal, there is a 45-second 'goal break'. This break is for the broadcaster to show replays of the goal and for the defending team to decide whether to initiate a coach's challenge (if Rule 38 is used in the game).",

Should an infraction of the rules which would call for a Minor, Bench Minor, Major, Misconduct or Game Misconduct be committed by Player or Team Personnel of the Team not in control of the puck, the Referee shall raise their arm to signal the delayed calling of a penalty. When the Team to be penalized gains control of the puck, the Referees will blow their whistle to stop play and impose the penalty on the offending Player or Team. When a Player, Team Manager, Coach or team personnel is ejected from the game for a violation of the playing rules, that individual must vacate the Players’ Bench area and may not, in any manner, further participate in the game. This includes directing the Team from the spectator area or by radio communications. Any violations shall be reported to the Proper Authorities.A Player, Coach or team personnel shall not challenge or dispute the rulings of an Official before, during or after a game, on or off the ice and any location while in the arena and its connected premises. A Player, Coach or team personnel shall not display “Unsportsmanlike Conduct” including, but not limited to, obscene, profane or abusive language or gestures, comments of a personal nature intended to degrade an Official or persist in disputing a ruling after being told to stop or after being penalized for such behavior. Note: When such conduct is directed at any one other than an official, (Rule 75 – Unsportsmanlike Conduct) shall be applied.A Minor Penalty for “Delay of Game” shall be assessed: (I) On any Player, including the Goalkeeper, who holds, “freezes” or plays the puck with their stick, skates or body in such a manner as to deliberately cause a stoppage of play. Regarding to a Goalkeeper, this rule applies outside of their Goal Crease area; (II) On any Player who deliberately shoots or bats (using their hand or stick) the puck outside the playing area (from anywhere on the ice surface) during the play or after a stoppage of play; (III) On any Player who shoots or bats (using their hand or stick) the puck directly (non-deflected) out of the playing surface from their Defending Zone, except where there is no Protective Glass. The determining factor shall be the position of the puck when it was shot or batted by the offending Player. If contact with the puck occurs while the puck is inside the Defending Zone, and subsequently goes out of play, the Minor Penalty shall be assessed. When the puck is shot over the Protective Glass surrounding the Players’ Bench, the penalty will be assessed. Note: When the puck is shot into the Players’ Bench, the penalty will not apply. When the puck goes out of the playing area directly off a “face-off”, no penalty shall be assessed; (IV) On any Player who delays the game by deliberately displacing a Goal Post from its normal position. The Referee shall stop play immediately when the offending Team gains “control” of the puck. Note: If a Player deliberately displaces a Goal Post from its normal position when an opponent has an imminent scoring opportunity on an open net, a goal may be awarded by the Referee (Rule 63.7 – Awarded Goal) (V) On a Player other than the Goalkeeper who deliberately falls on or gathers the puck into their body; Note: Any Player who drops to their knees to block a shot should not be penalized if the puck is shot under them or becomes lodged in their clothing or equipment but any use of the hands to make the puck unplayable should be penalized promptly; (VI) On a Goalkeeper who “races out” of their Goal Crease in an attempt to beat the attacking Player to the puck and instead of playing the puck jumps on the puck causing a stoppage of play; Note: If a Goalkeeper comes out of their Goal Crease to “cut down the angle” on a shot and after making the save covers the puck, this shall be legal. (VII) On a Goalkeeper who, when they are in their own Goal Crease, deliberately falls on or gathers the puck into their body or who holds or places the puck against any part of the goal in such a manner as to cause a stoppage of play unless they are actually being checked by an opponent; (VIII) On a Goalkeeper who plays the puck outside of the Designated Area behind the net. The determining factor shall be the position of the puck. Note: The Minor Penalty will not be assessed when a Goalkeeper plays the puck while maintaining skate contact with the Goal Crease. (IX) For adjustments to clothing, equipment, skates, or sticks. Note: No penalty should be assessed when a water bottle is delivered to a Goalkeeper, however, this should be conducted during time-outs and if, in the opinion of the Referee, it is being done to intentionally delay the game, a Minor Penalty may be assessed. (X) No delay shall be permitted for the repair or adjustment of Goalkeeper’s equipment. If adjustments are required, the Goalkeeper shall leave the ice and their place shall be taken by the substitute Goalkeeper immediately.

                    "context": "A boarding penalty shall be imposed on any Player who checks or pushes a defenseless opponent in such a manner that causes the opponent to hit or impact the Boards violently or dangerously.The severity of the penalty, based upon the impact with the Boards, shall be at the discretion of the Referee. There is a considerable amount of judgment involved in the application of this rule by the Referees. The responsibility is on the Player applying the check to ensure their opponent is not in a defenseless position and if so, they must avoid or minimize contact. However, in determining whether such contact could have been avoided, the circumstances of the check, including whether the opponent put themself in a vulnerable position immediately prior to or simultaneously with the check or whether the check was unavoidable can be considered. This balance must be considered by the Referees when applying this rule. Any unnecessary contact with a Player playing the puck on an obvious “icing” or “off-side” play which results in that Player hitting or impacting the Boards is “boarding” and must be penalized as such. In other instances where there is no contact with the Boards, it should be treated as “charging”.All “face-off” must be conducted on one of the nine (9) Face-off Spots located on the Rink. If two (2) rule violations are the reason for the stoppage of play (e.g.: “high-sticking the puck” and “intentional off-side”), the ensuing “face-off location” shall be determined as the spot that provides the least amount of “territorial advantage” to the offending Team. When the play is stopped for any reason not specifically attributable to either Team while the puck is in the Neutral Zone, the ensuing “face-off” shall be conducted at the nearest Face-off Spot outside the Blue Line whenever possible. When it is unclear as to which of the four (4) Face-off Spots is the nearest, the spot that gives the Home Team the greatest “territorial advantage” in the Neutral Zone will be selected for the ensuing “face-off”. When Players are penalized at a stoppage of play so as to result in penalties being placed on the penalty time clock to one Team, the ensuing “face-off” shall be conducted at one of the two (2) Face-off Spots in the offending Team’s Defending Zone. There are only three (3) exceptions to this application: (I) when a penalty is assessed after the scoring of a goal – “face-off” shall be conducted at Center ice; (II) when a penalty is assessed at the end (or start) of a period – “face-off” shall be conducted at Center ice; (III) or when the defending Team is penalized, and the attacking Players enter the Attacking Zone beyond the outer edge of the End Zone Face-off Circle – “face-off” shall be conducted in the Neutral Zone. The Team awarded the “Power-Play” will have the choice of which End Zone spot the “face-off” will take place at to start the “Power-Play”. When an infringement of a rule has been committed by Players of both Teams in the play resulting in the stoppage, the ensuing “face-off” will be conducted at the nearest Face-off Spot in that zone. When stoppage occurs between the end Face-off Spots and near end of the Rink, the puck shall be faced-off at the end Face-off Spot on the side where the stoppage occurs unless otherwise expressly provided by these rules. No “face-off” shall be made within 4.50 m of the goal or side Boards nor anywhere other than at a Face-off Spot. When a goal is illegally scored as a result of a puck being deflected directly off an Official, the resulting “face-off” shall be made at the nearest Face-off Spot in the zone where the puck deflected off of the Official. When a goal is illegally scored by the attacking Team by “directing”, “batting”, “kicking” or “high-sticking” the puck into the goal, the resulting “face-off” shall take place in the Neutral Zone at the nearest Face-off Spot. When the game is stopped for any reason not specifically covered in the official rules, the puck must be “faced-off” at a Face-off Spot in the zone nearest to where it was last played. Following a stoppage of play, should one or both defensemen who are the “point Players” or any Player coming from the Players’ Bench of the attacking Team, enter into the Attacking Zone beyond the outer edge of the End Zone Face-off Circle during an altercation, “gathering or scrum”, the ensuing “face-off” shall take place in the Neutral Zone near the Blue Line of the defending Team. This rule also applies when an “icing”, an “intentional off-side”, or a penalty has been assessed, and the ensuing “face-off” is to be in the offending Team’s Defending Zone. Should any of the non-offending Players enter the Attacking Zone beyond the outer edge of the End Zone Face-off Circle during an altercation, “gathering or scrum”, the ensuing “face-off” shall take place in the Neutral Zone near the Blue Line of the defending Team. For a violation of (Rule 71 – Premature Substitution) the resulting “face-off” will take place at the Center ice Face-off Spot when play is stopped beyond the Center red line. When play is stopped prior to the Center red line, the resulting “face-off” shall be conducted at the nearest Face-off Spot in the zone where the play was stopped. When play is stopped for an injured Player, the ensuing “face-off” shall be conducted at the Face-off Spot in the zone nearest the location of the puck when the play was stopped. When the injured Player’s Team has “control of the puck” in the Attacking Zone, the “face-off” shall be conducted at one of the Face-off Spots outside the Blue Line in the Neutral Zone. When the injured Player is in their Defending Zone and the attacking Team is in “control of the puck” in the Attacking Zone, the “face-off” shall be conducted at one of the defending Team’s end-zone Face-off Spots.",

Charging shall mean the actions of a Player who either jumps to check an opponent, builds up speed by taking multiple strides immediately prior to making contact and / or travels an excessive distance with the sole purpose of delivering such a hit and / or violently checks an opponent in any manner. A “charge” may be the result of a check into the Boards, into the goal frame or in open ice. Any unnecessary contact with a Player playing the puck on an obvious “icing” or “off-side” play which results in that Player hitting or impacting the Boards is “boarding” and must be penalized as such. In other instances where there is no contact with the Boards, it should be treated as “charging.” This rule is superseded by all similar actions regarding an “illegal hit to the head”, except those related to “fighting”. A penalty shall be imposed on a Player who charges a Goalkeeper while the Goalkeeper is within their Goal Crease. A Goalkeeper is not “fair game” just because they are outside the Goal Crease area. The appropriate penalty should be assessed in every case where an opposing Player makes unnecessary contact with a Goalkeeper. However, incidental contact, at the discretion of the Referee, will be permitted when the Goalkeeper is in the act of playing the puck outside their Goal Crease, provided the attacking Player has made a reasonable effort to avoid such contact. The Referee shall, at their discretion, assess a Minor Penalty, based on the degree of force and violence of the check, to a Player guilty of “charging” an opponent. The Referee, at their discretion, may assess a Major Penalty to a Player guilty of “charging” an opponent, and who recklessly endangers the fouled Player in a way that at the discretion of the Referee such Player would not be sufficiently sanctioned by imposing a Minor Penalty. The Referee, at their discretion, may assess a Major Penalty and a Game Misconduct Penalty if, in their judgment, the Player recklessly endangers their opponent by “charging” and the player would not be sufficiently sanctioned by imposing a Major Penalty. Such assessment of reckless endangerment shall be based on the severity of the infraction, severity of the contact, the degree of violence and the general reprehensibility involved. If deemed appropriate, Supplementary Discipline can be applied by the Proper Authorities at their discretion. (Rule 28 – Supplementary Discipline)In all cases in which an attacking Player initiates “intentional or deliberate” contact with a Goalkeeper, whether or not the Goalkeeper is inside or outside the Goal Crease, and whether or not a goal is scored, the attacking Player will receive a penalty (Minor or Major, as the Referee deems appropriate). In all cases where the infraction being imposed is to the attacking Player for hindering the Goalkeeper’s ability to move freely in their Goal Crease, the penalty to be assessed is for “Goalkeeper interference”. In exercising their judgment, the Referee should give more significant consideration to the degree and nature of the relevant contact with the Goalkeeper than to the exact location of the Goalkeeper at the time of the contact.",

Players who willingly participate in a “brawl / fight”, so-called “willing combatants”, shall be penalized accordingly by the Referee(s) and may be ejected from the game. Further Supplementary Discipline may be imposed. A “fight” shall be deemed to have occurred when at least one (1) Player punches or attempts to punch an opponent repeatedly or when two (2) Players wrestle in such a manner as to make it difficult for the Linespersons to intervene and separate the combatants. Any Player who persists in continuing or attempting to continue a “fight or altercation” after they have been ordered by the Referee to stop, or who resists a Linesperson in the discharge of their duties shall, at the discretion of the Referee, incur at least a Major Penalty (“Fighting”) plus an automatic Game Misconduct Penalty (5’+GMP) in addition to any additional penalties imposed. The Referees are provided very wide latitude in penalties they may impose under this rule. This is done intentionally to enable them to differentiate between the obvious degrees of responsibility of the participants either for starting the “fight or persisting in continuing the fight”. The discretion provided should be exercised rationally. For Players, Coaches or Team Personnel leaving the Players' Benches or the Penalty Boxes, see (Rule 70 – Leaving the Players’ Bench or Penalty Box) An “altercation” is a situation involving at least two (2) Players with at least one Player (1) to be penalized. An “Instigator / Initiator” of an “altercation” shall be a Player who by their actions or demeanor demonstrates any/some of the following criteria: distance traveled; gloves off first; first punch thrown; menacing attitude or posture; verbal instigation or threats; conduct in retaliation to a prior game incident; obvious retribution for a previous incident in the game. A Player who is deemed to be the “Instigator / Initiator” of an “altercation” shall be assessed a Minor Penalty (Instigator / Initiator) plus a Major Penalty (“Fighting”) and an automatic Game Misconduct Penalty (2’+5’+GMP). A Player who is deemed to be both the “Instigator / Initiator” and the “Aggressor” of an “altercation” shall be assessed a Minor Penalty (“Instigator / Initiator”) plus a Minor Penalty (“Aggressor”) plus a Major Penalty (“Fighting”) and an automatic Game Misconduct Penalty (2’+2’+5’+GMP). The “Aggressor” in an altercation shall be the Player who continues to throw punches in an attempt to inflict punishment on their opponent who is in a defenseless position or who is an “unwilling combatant”. A Player must be deemed the “Aggressor” when they have clearly won the “fight”, but they continue throwing and landing punches in a further attempt to inflict punishment and/or injury on their opponent who is no longer in a position to defend themself. A Player who is deemed to be the “Aggressor” of an altercation shall be assessed a Minor Penalty (“Aggressor”) plus a Major Penalty (“Fighting”) and an automatic Game Misconduct Penalty (2’+5’+GMP). A Player who is deemed to be the “Aggressor of an altercation” will have this recorded as an “Aggressor” of an altercation for suspension purposes – refer to Rule 28 Supplementary Discipline. A Player who is deemed to be both the “Aggressor” and the “Instigator / Initiator” of an altercation shall be assessed a Minor Penalty (“Aggressor”) plus a Minor Penalty (“Instigator / Initiator”) plus a Major Penalty (“Fighting”) and an automatic Game Misconduct Penalty (2’+2’+5’+GMP). Any Player wearing tape or any other material on their hands (below the wrist) who cuts or injures an opponent during an altercation will receive a Major Penalty and an automatic Game Misconduct Penalty (5’+GMP) in addition to any other penalties imposed including for “fighting” under this rule. A Major Penalty and an automatic Game Misconduct Penalty (5’+GMP) shall be assessed to a Player who punches an unsuspecting or “unwilling combatant / opponent” (i.e., “sucker punch”) and could cause an injury. A Player who ”defends” themself with a ”few punches” against an Aggressor, an Instigator / Initiator or a fighter shall be considered as an “unwilling combatant”. This Player does not want to continue or prolong a “fight” or “let a fight get out of hand” – it is clear to the Referees that this player does not want to “fight” irregularly. A Player who retaliates to being punched will be assessed at least a Minor Penalty (“Roughing”) or a Major Penalty (“Fighting”, without a Game Misconduct Penalty), if the criteria for “fighting back” with a few punches is not fulfilled. A Game Misconduct Penalty, at the discretion of the Referee, shall be imposed on any Player who is the first to intervene (“third Player in”) in an altercation already in progress, except when a Game Misconduct Penalty is being imposed in the original altercation. This penalty is in addition to any other penalties incurred in the same incident. This rule also applies to subsequent Players who elect to intervene in the same or other “altercations” during the same stoppage of play. Generally, this rule is applied when a “fight” occurs. When a “fight” occurs, all Players not engaged shall go immediately to the area of their Players’ Bench and in the event the altercation takes place at a Players’ Bench, the Players on the ice from that Team shall go to their Defending Zone. Goalkeepers shall remain in their Goal Crease, except in the event the altercation takes place in the vicinity of the Goal Crease, and therefore shall obey the directions of the Referee. Failure to comply can result in penalties incurred for their involvement in and around the area and Disciplinary Measures. Any Teams whose Players become involved in an altercation, other than during the periods of the game, will be investigated by proper authorities and supplementary discipline can be applied in addition to any other appropriate penalties that may be imposed upon the participating Players by Supplementary Discipline or otherwise. Players involved in “fighting” other than during the periods of the game shall be assessed a Major Penalty (“Fighting”) and an automatic Game Misconduct Penalty (5’+GMP). An “Aggressor” and/ or an “Instigator / Initiator” shall be penalized according to the respective Rule 46.3 and/or Rule 46.4. In the case of altercations taking place after the period or game will be reported to the Proper Authorities for further Supplementary Disciplinary action. Should Players come onto the ice from their Players’ Benches after the period ends and prior to the start of an altercation, they shall not be penalized if they remain in the vicinity of their Players’ Bench and provided, they do not get involved in any altercations. Unless this occurs prior to the start of the game or any period, a “fight” that occurs prior to the drop of the puck during the course of normal “face-off”, the altercation shall be penalized as if it occurred during the regular playing time refer to Rule 46.9 – Fighting. When, in the opinion of the Referee that, specific personnel changes have been made by one or both Teams late in a game and an altercation ensues, the appropriate penalties are to be assessed and the incident reported to the Proper Authorities immediately following the game for review and possible Supplementary Disciplinary actions. A Game Misconduct Penalty shall be imposed on any Player involved in “fighting off the playing surface” or with another Player who is “off the playing surface”. These penalties are in addition to any other time penalties assessed, including the Major Penalty (“Fighting”). Whenever a Coach or other team personnel becomes involved in an altercation with an opposing Player, Coach or other team personnel on or off the ice, they shall be assessed with a Game Misconduct Penalty and automatically suspended from the game, ordered to the Dressing Room and the matter will be reported to Proper Authorities for Supplementary Disciplinary actions. No Player may remove their helmet prior to engaging in a fight. If they should do so, they shall be assessed a Minor Penalty for “Unsportsmanlike Conduct”. Helmets that come off in the course of and resulting from the altercation will not result in a penalty to either Player. A Player who deliberately removes their jersey prior to participating in an altercation or who is clearly wearing a jersey that has been modified and does not conform to (Rule 9 – Uniforms) , shall be assessed a Minor Penalty for “Unsportsmanlike Conduct” and an automatic Game Misconduct Penalty (2´+GMP). This is in addition to other penalties to be assessed to the participants of an altercation. If the “altercation” never materializes, the Player would receive a Minor Penalty for “Unsportsmanlike Conduct” and a ten-minute (10’) Misconduct Penalty for deliberately removing their jersey.",

No Player may remove their helmet prior to engaging in a fight. If they should do so, they shall be assessed a Minor Penalty for “Unsportsmanlike Conduct”. Helmets that come off in the course of and resulting from the altercation will not result in a penalty to either Player. A Player who deliberately removes their jersey prior to participating in an altercation or who is clearly wearing a jersey that has been modified and does not conform to (Rule 9 – Uniforms) , shall be assessed a Minor Penalty for “Unsportsmanlike Conduct” and an automatic Game Misconduct Penalty (2´+GMP). This is in addition to other penalties to be assessed to the participants of an altercation. If the “altercation” never materializes, the Player would receive a Minor Penalty for “Unsportsmanlike Conduct” and a ten-minute (10’) Misconduct Penalty for deliberately removing their jersey.",

Players who willingly participate in a “brawl / fight”, so-called “willing combatants”, shall be penalized accordingly by the Referee(s) and may be ejected from the game. Further Supplementary Discipline may be imposed. A “fight” shall be deemed to have occurred when at least one (1) Player punches or attempts to punch an opponent repeatedly or when two (2) Players wrestle in such a manner as to make it difficult for the Linespersons to intervene and separate the combatants. Any Player who persists in continuing or attempting to continue a “fight or altercation” after they have been ordered by the Referee to stop, or who resists a Linesperson in the discharge of their duties shall, at the discretion of the Referee, incur at least a Major Penalty (“Fighting”) plus an automatic Game Misconduct Penalty (5’+GMP) in addition to any additional penalties imposed. The Referees are provided very wide latitude in penalties they may impose under this rule. This is done intentionally to enable them to differentiate between the obvious degrees of responsibility of the participants either for starting the “fight or persisting in continuing the fight”. The discretion provided should be exercised rationally. For Players, Coaches or Team Personnel leaving the Players' Benches or the Penalty Boxes, see (Rule 70 – Leaving the Players’ Bench or Penalty Box) An “altercation” is a situation involving at least two (2) Players with at least one Player (1) to be penalized. An “Instigator / Initiator” of an “altercation” shall be a Player who by their actions or demeanor demonstrates any/some of the following criteria: distance traveled; gloves off first; first punch thrown; menacing attitude or posture; verbal instigation or threats; conduct in retaliation to a prior game incident; obvious retribution for a previous incident in the game. A Player who is deemed to be the “Instigator / Initiator” of an “altercation” shall be assessed a Minor Penalty (Instigator / Initiator) plus a Major Penalty (“Fighting”) and an automatic Game Misconduct Penalty (2’+5’+GMP). A Player who is deemed to be both the “Instigator / Initiator” and the “Aggressor” of an “altercation” shall be assessed a Minor Penalty (“Instigator / Initiator”) plus a Minor Penalty (“Aggressor”) plus a Major Penalty (“Fighting”) and an automatic Game Misconduct Penalty (2’+2’+5’+GMP). The “Aggressor” in an altercation shall be the Player who continues to throw punches in an attempt to inflict punishment on their opponent who is in a defenseless position or who is an “unwilling combatant”. A Player must be deemed the “Aggressor” when they have clearly won the “fight”, but they continue throwing and landing punches in a further attempt to inflict punishment and/or injury on their opponent who is no longer in a position to defend themself. A Player who is deemed to be the “Aggressor” of an altercation shall be assessed a Minor Penalty (“Aggressor”) plus a Major Penalty (“Fighting”) and an automatic Game Misconduct Penalty (2’+5’+GMP).

A Player who is deemed to be both the “Aggressor” and the “Instigator / Initiator” of an altercation shall be assessed a Minor Penalty (“Aggressor”) plus a Minor Penalty (“Instigator / Initiator”) plus a Major Penalty (“Fighting”) and an automatic Game Misconduct Penalty (2’+2’+5’+GMP). Any Player wearing tape or any other material on their hands (below the wrist) who cuts or injures an opponent during an altercation will receive a Major Penalty and an automatic Game Misconduct Penalty (5’+GMP) in addition to any other penalties imposed including for “fighting” under this rule. A Major Penalty and an automatic Game Misconduct Penalty (5’+GMP) shall be assessed to a Player who punches an unsuspecting or “unwilling combatant / opponent” (i.e., “sucker punch”) and could cause an injury. A Player who ”defends” themself with a ”few punches” against an Aggressor, an Instigator / Initiator or a fighter shall be considered as an “unwilling combatant”. This Player does not want to continue or prolong a “fight” or “let a fight get out of hand” – it is clear to the Referees that this player does not want to “fight” irregularly. A Player who retaliates to being punched will be assessed at least a Minor Penalty (“Roughing”) or a Major Penalty (“Fighting”, without a Game Misconduct Penalty), if the criteria for “fighting back” with a few punches is not fulfilled. A Game Misconduct Penalty, at the discretion of the Referee, shall be imposed on any Player who is the first to intervene (“third Player in”) in an altercation already in progress, except when a Game Misconduct Penalty is being imposed in the original altercation. This penalty is in addition to any other penalties incurred in the same incident. This rule also applies to subsequent Players who elect to intervene in the same or other “altercations” during the same stoppage of play. Generally, this rule is applied when a “fight” occurs. When a “fight” occurs, all Players not engaged shall go immediately to the area of their Players’ Bench and in the event the altercation takes place at a Players’ Bench, the Players on the ice from that Team shall go to their Defending Zone. Goalkeepers shall remain in their Goal Crease, except in the event the altercation takes place in the vicinity of the Goal Crease, and therefore shall obey the directions of the Referee.

Unless this occurs prior to the start of the game or any period, a “fight” that occurs prior to the drop of the puck during the course of normal “face-off”, the altercation shall be penalized as if it occurred during the regular playing time refer to Rule 46.9 – Fighting.

Where Goalkeepers are involved, refer to (Rule 27.1 – Goalkeeper Penalties ➔) Immediate substitution shall be made for an “Equal Number of Minor Penalties or “Coincidental Minor Penalties of Equal Duration” to each Team penalized and the penalties of the Players for which substitutions have been made shall not be taken into account for the purpose of the “Delayed Penalty” rule (Rule 26 – Delayed Penalties) When multiple penalties are assessed to both Teams, “Equal Numbers of Minor and Major Penalties” shall be eliminated using the “Coincidental Penalty” rule and any differential in time penalties shall be served in the normal manner and displayed on the penalty time clock accordingly – see Rule 19.5 – Applying the Coincidental Penalty Rule. If there is no differential in time penalties, all Players will serve their allotted penalty time, but will not be released until the first stoppage of play following the expiration of their respective penalties.

Players who willingly participate in a “brawl / fight”, so-called “willing combatants”, shall be penalized accordingly by the Referee(s) and may be ejected from the game. Further Supplementary Discipline may be imposed. A “fight” shall be deemed to have occurred when at least one (1) Player punches or attempts to punch an opponent repeatedly or when two (2) Players wrestle in such a manner as to make it difficult for the Linespersons to intervene and separate the combatants. Any Player who persists in continuing or attempting to continue a “fight or altercation” after they have been ordered by the Referee to stop, or who resists a Linesperson in the discharge of their duties shall, at the discretion of the Referee, incur at least a Major Penalty (“Fighting”) plus an automatic Game Misconduct Penalty (5’+GMP) in addition to any additional penalties imposed. The Referees are provided very wide latitude in penalties they may impose under this rule. This is done intentionally to enable them to differentiate between the obvious degrees of responsibility of the participants either for starting the “fight or persisting in continuing the fight”. The discretion provided should be exercised rationally. For Players, Coaches or Team Personnel leaving the Players' Benches or the Penalty Boxes, see (Rule 70 – Leaving the Players’ Bench or Penalty Box) An “altercation” is a situation involving at least two (2) Players with at least one Player (1) to be penalized. An “Instigator / Initiator” of an “altercation” shall be a Player who by their actions or demeanor demonstrates any/some of the following criteria: distance traveled; gloves off first; first punch thrown; menacing attitude or posture; verbal instigation or threats; conduct in retaliation to a prior game incident; obvious retribution for a previous incident in the game. A Player who is deemed to be the “Instigator / Initiator” of an “altercation” shall be assessed a Minor Penalty (Instigator / Initiator) plus a Major Penalty (“Fighting”) and an automatic Game Misconduct Penalty (2’+5’+GMP). A Player who is deemed to be both the “Instigator / Initiator” and the “Aggressor” of an “altercation” shall be assessed a Minor Penalty (“Instigator / Initiator”) plus a Minor Penalty (“Aggressor”) plus a Major Penalty (“Fighting”) and an automatic Game Misconduct Penalty (2’+2’+5’+GMP). The “Aggressor” in an altercation shall be the Player who continues to throw punches in an attempt to inflict punishment on their opponent who is in a defenseless position or who is an “unwilling combatant”. A Player must be deemed the “Aggressor” when they have clearly won the “fight”, but they continue throwing and landing punches in a further attempt to inflict punishment and/or injury on their opponent who is no longer in a position to defend themself. A Player who is deemed to be the “Aggressor” of an altercation shall be assessed a Minor Penalty (“Aggressor”) plus a Major Penalty (“Fighting”) and an automatic Game Misconduct Penalty (2’+5’+GMP). A Player who is deemed to be the “Aggressor of an altercation” will have this recorded as an “Aggressor” of an altercation for suspension purposes – refer to Rule 28 Supplementary Discipline. A Player who is deemed to be both the “Aggressor” and the “Instigator / Initiator” of an altercation shall be assessed a Minor Penalty (“Aggressor”) plus a Minor Penalty (“Instigator / Initiator”) plus a Major Penalty (“Fighting”) and an automatic Game Misconduct Penalty (2’+2’+5’+GMP). Any Player wearing tape or any other material on their hands (below the wrist) who cuts or injures an opponent during an altercation will receive a Major Penalty and an automatic Game Misconduct Penalty (5’+GMP) in addition to any other penalties imposed including for “fighting” under this rule. A Major Penalty and an automatic Game Misconduct Penalty (5’+GMP) shall be assessed to a Player who punches an unsuspecting or “unwilling combatant / opponent” (i.e., “sucker punch”) and could cause an injury. A Player who ”defends” themself with a ”few punches” against an Aggressor, an Instigator / Initiator or a fighter shall be considered as an “unwilling combatant”. This Player does not want to continue or prolong a “fight” or “let a fight get out of hand” – it is clear to the Referees that this player does not want to “fight” irregularly. A Player who retaliates to being punched will be assessed at least a Minor Penalty (“Roughing”) or a Major Penalty (“Fighting”, without a Game Misconduct Penalty), if the criteria for “fighting back” with a few punches is not fulfilled. A Game Misconduct Penalty, at the discretion of the Referee, shall be imposed on any Player who is the first to intervene (“third Player in”) in an altercation already in progress, except when a Game Misconduct Penalty is being imposed in the original altercation. This penalty is in addition to any other penalties incurred in the same incident. This rule also applies to subsequent Players who elect to intervene in the same or other “altercations” during the same stoppage of play. Generally, this rule is applied when a “fight” occurs. When a “fight” occurs, all Players not engaged shall go immediately to the area of their Players’ Bench and in the event the altercation takes place at a Players’ Bench, the Players on the ice from that Team shall go to their Defending Zone. Goalkeepers shall remain in their Goal Crease, except in the event the altercation takes place in the vicinity of the Goal Crease, and therefore shall obey the directions of the Referee. Failure to comply can result in penalties incurred for their involvement in and around the area and Disciplinary Measures. Any Teams whose Players become involved in an altercation, other than during the periods of the game, will be investigated by proper authorities and supplementary discipline can be applied in addition to any other appropriate penalties that may be imposed upon the participating Players by Supplementary Discipline or otherwise. Players involved in “fighting” other than during the periods of the game shall be assessed a Major Penalty (“Fighting”) and an automatic Game Misconduct Penalty (5’+GMP). An “Aggressor” and/ or an “Instigator / Initiator” shall be penalized according to the respective Rule 46.3 and/or Rule 46.4. In the case of altercations taking place after the period or game will be reported to the Proper Authorities for further Supplementary Disciplinary action. Should Players come onto the ice from their Players’ Benches after the period ends and prior to the start of an altercation, they shall not be penalized if they remain in the vicinity of their Players’ Bench and provided, they do not get involved in any altercations. Unless this occurs prior to the start of the game or any period, a “fight” that occurs prior to the drop of the puck during the course of normal “face-off”, the altercation shall be penalized as if it occurred during the regular playing time refer to Rule 46.9 – Fighting. When, in the opinion of the Referee that, specific personnel changes have been made by one or both Teams late in a game and an altercation ensues, the appropriate penalties are to be assessed and the incident reported to the Proper Authorities immediately following the game for review and possible Supplementary Disciplinary actions. A Game Misconduct Penalty shall be imposed on any Player involved in “fighting off the playing surface” or with another Player who is “off the playing surface”. These penalties are in addition to any other time penalties assessed, including the Major Penalty (“Fighting”). Whenever a Coach or other team personnel becomes involved in an altercation with an opposing Player, Coach or other team personnel on or off the ice, they shall be assessed with a Game Misconduct Penalty and automatically suspended from the game, ordered to the Dressing Room and the matter will be reported to Proper Authorities for Supplementary Disciplinary actions. No Player may remove their helmet prior to engaging in a fight. If they should do so, they shall be assessed a Minor Penalty for “Unsportsmanlike Conduct”. Helmets that come off in the course of and resulting from the altercation will not result in a penalty to either Player. A Player who deliberately removes their jersey prior to participating in an altercation or who is clearly wearing a jersey that has been modified and does not conform to (Rule 9 – Uniforms) , shall be assessed a Minor Penalty for “Unsportsmanlike Conduct” and an automatic Game Misconduct Penalty (2´+GMP). This is in addition to other penalties to be assessed to the participants of an altercation. If the “altercation” never materializes, the Player would receive a Minor Penalty for “Unsportsmanlike Conduct” and a ten-minute (10’) Misconduct Penalty for deliberately removing their jersey.",

A hit resulting in contact with an opponent’s head where the head was the main point of contact and such contact to the head was avoidable is not permitted. This rule supersedes all similar actions regarding hits to the head and neck. When a Player is skating with their head up, whether they are in possession of the puck and may reasonably be expecting impending contact, an opponent does not have the right to hit them on the head or neck. A Player who delivers a bodycheck to an opponent who is skating with the puck with their head down in the direction of the Player and does not use an upward motion or drive their body up into the opponent, shall not be penalized for an “illegal check to the head”. A penalty for “Illegal check to the head or neck” will be assessed if one of the following occurs when a player checks an opponent: (I) A Player who directs a hit of any sort, with any part of their body or equipment, to the head or neck of an opposing Player or drives or forces the head of an opposing Player into the protective glass or boards using any part of their upper body. (II) A Player who extends and directs any part of their upper body to contact the head or neck of an opponent. (III) A Player who extends their body upward or outward in order to reach their opponent or uses any part of the upper body to contact an opponent’s head or neck. (IV) A Player who jumps (leaves their skates) to deliver a blow to the head or neck of an opponent. In determining whether contact with an opponent's head was avoidable, the circumstances of the hit including the following shall be considered: (V) Whether the Player attempted to hit squarely through the opponent’s body and the head was not \"picked\" as a result of poor timing, poor angle of approach, or unnecessary extension of the body upward or outward. If the primary force of a blow is initially to the body area and then contact slides up to the head or neck. (VI) Whether the opponent put themself in a vulnerable position by assuming a posture that made head contact on an otherwise full body check unavoidable. (VII) Whether the opponent materially changed the position of their body or head immediately prior to or simultaneously with the hit in a way that significantly contributed to the head contact. The Referee shall, at their discretion, assess a Minor Penalty to any Player who delivers an “illegal check to the head or neck” of an opponent. The Referee, at their discretion, may assess a Major Penalty and an automatic Game Misconduct Penalty if, in their judgment, the Player recklessly endangers their opponent by an “illegal check to the head or neck”.

A puck that is “directed” into the net by an attacking Player’s skate shall be a legitimate goal as long as “no distinct kicking motion” is evident. The following should clarify deflections following a “kicked puck” that enters the goal: (I) A “kicked puck” that “deflects” off the body of any Player of either Team (including the Goalkeeper) shall be ruled “no goal”. (II) A “kicked puck” that “deflects” off the stick of any Player (excluding the Goalkeeper’s stick) shall be ruled a “good goal”. (III) A goal will be allowed when an attacking Player “kicks” the puck, and the puck “deflects” off their own stick and then into the net. (IV) A goal will be allowed when a puck enters the goal after “deflecting” off an attacking Player’s skate or “deflects” off their skate while they are in the “process of stopping”. A goal cannot be scored by an attacking Player who “kicks” any equipment (stick, glove, helmet, etc.) at the puck, including “kicking” the blade of their own stick, causing the puck to cross the Goal Line.",

The Goalkeeper is considered off the ice once the replacement Player has entered the Playing Surface.When a Player carries or holds any part of their stick above the shoulders and makes contact with their opponent’s neck, face or head so that “injury results”, in the manner of drawing blood or otherwise, the Referee shall assess a Double-minor Penalty.

(Rule 18.4 – On-ice Video Review of Double-minor Penalties for High-sticking)A Minor Penalty for “Unsportsmanlike Conduct” shall be assessed under this rule for the following infractions: (I) Any identifiable Player who uses obscene, profane or abusive language or gestures directed at any person. An additional Game Misconduct Penalty for use of obscene gestures, racial slurs or taunts or sexual remarks – refer to Rule 75.5 – Game Misconduct Penalty. (II) Any Player who is guilty of “Unsportsmanlike Conduct” including, but not limited to hair-pulling, grabbing hold of a face mask, banging with a stick or another object at the Boards or glass, etc. during the progress of the game or during a stoppage of play. Note: \"If the Referee classifies physical offences committed to be serious and severe, based on the degree of force, the Referee may apply: (Rule 21 – Dangerous Actions) (III) Any Player who throws any object onto the ice from the Players’ or Penalty Box (or from any other off-ice location); (IV) A Player who deliberately removes their jersey or their helmet prior to participating in an altercation or who is clearly wearing a jersey that has been modified and does not conform to (Rule 9 – Uniforms) , shall be assessed a Minor Penalty for “Unsportsmanlike Conduct” and a Game Misconduct. If the altercation never materializes, the Player shall receive a Minor Penalty for “Unsportsmanlike Conduct” and a ten-minute (10) Misconduct Penalty for deliberately removing their jersey. If a penalized Player is assessed an additional “Unsportsmanlike Conduct” penalty either before or after they begin serving their original penalties, the additional Minor Penalty is added to their unexpired time and served consecutively.",

For the purpose of this rule, an “open net” is defined as one from which a Goalkeeper has been removed for an additional attacking Player. The Goalkeeper is considered off the ice once the replacement Player has entered the Playing Surface.Apparent goals shall be disallowed by the Referee and the appropriate announcement made by the Public Address Announcer for the following reasons: (I) When the puck has been directed with any part of their body (excl. skates), batted or thrown into the net by an attacking Player other than with a stick. When this occurs, if it is deemed to be done deliberately, then the decision shall be NO GOAL. A goal cannot be scored when the puck has been deliberately batted with any part of the attacking Player’s body into the net (Rule 78.4 – Scoring a Goal) (II) When the puck has been kicked using a distinct kicking motion (Rule 49.2 – Kicking) (III) When the puck has deflected directly into the net off an official (Rule 85.4 – Puck Striking Official) (IV) When a goal has been scored and an ineligible Player is on the ice (Rule 68.5 – Disallowed Goal) (V) When an attacking Player has interfered with a Goalkeeper in their Goal Crease (Rule 69.1 – Interference on the Goalkeeper) (VI) When the puck has entered the net after making contact with an attacking Player’s stick that is above the height of the crossbar. Where the puck makes contact with the stick is the determining factor (Rule 80.3 – Disallowed Goal) (VII) When Video Review confirms the scoring of a goal at one end of the ice, any goal scored at the other end on the same play must be disallowed (Rule 37.2 – Video Review) (VIII) When a Linesperson reports a Double-minor Penalty for high-sticking or a Major Penalty to the Referee following the scoring of a goal by the offending Team, the goal must be disallowed, and the appropriate penalty assessed (Rule 32.4 – Reporting to Referee) (IX) When a Goalkeeper has been pushed into the net together with the puck after making a save (Rule 69.7 – Rebounds and Loose Pucks) (X) When the net becomes displaced accidentally. The goal frame is considered to be displaced if either or both goal pegs are no longer in their respective holes in the ice, or the net has come completely off one or both pegs, prior to or as the puck enters the goal. However, if this occurs as a result of the actions of a defending player, refer to (Rule 63.7 – Awarded Goal) (XI) During the delayed calling of a penalty, the offending Team cannot score unless the non-offending Team shoots the puck into their own net. This shall mean that a deflection off an offending Player or any physical action by an offending Player that may cause the puck to enter the non-offending Team’s goal, shall not be considered a legal goal. Play shall be stopped before the puck enters the net (whenever possible) and the signaled penalty assessed to the offending Team; (XII) When the Referee deems the play has been stopped, even if they have not physically had the opportunity to stop play by blowing their whistle; (XIII) Any goal scored, other than as covered by the official rules, shall not be allowed.A Minor Penalty shall be imposed: (I) For throwing a stick on any Player on the Ice, who throws their stick or any part thereof or any other object in the direction of the puck or an opponent in any zone, except when such act has been penalized by the assessment of a “Penalty Shot” (Rule 53.7) or the Awarding of a Goal (Rule 53.8) ; (II) For throwing a stick when a defending Player shoots or throws a stick or any other object in the Defending Zone but not at the puck or puck carrier; (III) For “interference” when a Player moves a stick that is not broken and it interferes with an opposing Player (except where a “Penalty Shot” Rule 53.7 , or the Awarding of a Goal Rule 53.8 applies) or when the Player who lost said stick is prevented from retrieving it as a result; No penalty will be assessed if moving the non-broken stick if it does not interfere with the play or the opposing Player is not attempting to retrieve it. When a Player discards the broken portion of a stick or some other object by tossing it or shooting it to the side of the ice (and not over the Boards) in such a way as to not interfere with the play or opposing Player(s), no penalty will be imposed for so doing. (IV) For “Unsportsmanlike Conduct”, when a Player throws their stick or any part thereof or any other object or piece of equipment outside the Playing Area in protest of an Official’s decision.

                    "context": "A “Penalty Shot” is designed to restore a scoring opportunity which was lost as a result of an infraction being committed by the offending Team, based on the parameters set out in these rules. The Referee shall announce the reason for the assessed “Penalty Shot” and shall have the Skater selected by the Team entitled to take the “Penalty Shot” announced over the Public Address System. The puck shall then be placed on the Center Face-off Spot and the Player taking the “Penalty Shot” will, on the instruction of the Referee, by blowing their whistle, play the puck from there and shall attempt to score on the Goalkeeper. The puck must be kept in motion towards the opponent’s Goal Line and once it is shot, the play shall be considered complete. No goal can be scored on a rebound of any kind (an exception being the puck off the Goal Post or crossbar, then the Goalkeeper and then directly into the goal), and any time the puck crosses the Goal Line or comes to a complete stop, the “Penalty Shot” shall be considered complete. The “lacrosse-like move” whereby the puck is picked up on the blade of the stick and “whipped” into the net shall be permitted provided the puck is not raised above the height of the shoulders at any time and when released, is not carried higher than the crossbar. (Rule 80.1 – High-sticking the Puck) The “spin-o-rama type move” where the Player completes a 360° turn as they approach the goal, shall not be permitted. Should a Player perform such a move during the “Penalty Shot”, the shot shall be stopped by the Referee and no goal will be the result. Only a Player designated as a Goalkeeper or alternate Goalkeeper may defend against a “Penalty Shot”. The Goalkeeper must remain in their crease until the Player taking a “Penalty Shot” has touched the puck. If at the time a “Penalty Shot” is awarded, the Goalkeeper of the penalized Team has been removed from the ice to substitute another Player, the Goalkeeper shall be permitted to return to the ice before the “Penalty Shot” is taken. The Team against whom the “Penalty Shot” has been assessed may replace their Goalkeeper to defend against the shot, however, the substitute goalkeeper is required to remain in the game until the next stoppage of play. While the “Penalty Shot” is being taken, Players of both sides shall withdraw to the sides of the Rink and in front of their own Player’s Bench. In all cases where a “Penalty Shot” has been awarded, the “Penalty Shot” shall be taken by a Skater selected by the Coach or Captain of the non-offending Team from any non-penalized Skater of their Team. Such selection shall be reported to the Referee and cannot be changed. Should the Goalkeeper leave their Crease prior to the Player taking the “Penalty Shot” touching the puck, or committing any infraction, the Referee shall allow the “Penalty Shot” to be taken. If the “Penalty Shot” fails, the Referee shall permit the “Penalty Shot” to be taken over again. When an infraction worthy of a Minor Penalty is committed by the Goalkeeper during the “Penalty Shot” causing it to fail, no penalty is assessed but the Referee shall permit the “Penalty Shot” to be taken over again. Should a Goalkeeper commit a second (2nd) violation and the “Penalty Shot” fails, they shall be assessed a Misconduct Penalty and the Referee shall permit the “Penalty Shot” to be taken over again. A third (3rd) such violation shall result in the Goalkeeper being assessed a Game Misconduct Penalty and a goal shall be awarded. When a Major Penalty is committed by the Goalkeeper that causes the shot to fail, the Referee shall permit the “Penalty Shot” to be taken over again and the appropriate penalties shall be assessed to the Goalkeeper. The Goalkeeper may attempt to stop the “Penalty Shot” in any manner except by throwing their stick or any object, deliberately removes their helmet and/or face mask, or by deliberately dislodging the goal, in which case a goal shall be awarded. During the “Penalty Shot”, should the Goalkeeper, in an attempt at making a save, dislodge the goal accidentally, the Referee shall make one of the following determinations: (I) Award a goal if they deem the Player would have scored into the area normally occupied by the net had it not been dislodged. (II) Allow the “Penalty Shot” to be re-taken if they do not score or it could not be determined if the puck would have entered the area normally occupied by the net. (III) If the goal becomes dislodged after the puck has crossed the Goal Line thus ending the “Penalty Shot”, the above determinations do not apply, the “Penalty Shot” is complete. If, while a “Penalty Shot” is being taken, any Player, Coach or team personnel of the opposing Team interferes with or distracts the Player taking the “Penalty Shot” and, because of such action, the “Penalty Shot” fails, a second (2nd) attempt shall be permitted. The Referee shall impose a Bench Minor Penalty to the offending Team, and if a Player on the Bench is responsible, a Misconduct Penalty on the Player responsible shall be assessed. When a Coach or team personnel is guilty of such an act, a Game Misconduct Penalty shall be assessed on the responsible person and the matter will be reported to the Proper Authorities for possible further disciplinary action. If, while the “Penalty Shot” is being taken, any Player, Coach or team personnel of the Team taking the “Penalty Shot” interferes with or distracts the Goalkeeper defending the “Penalty Shot” and, because of such action, the shot is successful, the Referee shall rule no goal and shall impose a Bench Minor Penalty to the offending Team. If while the “Penalty Shot” is being taken a spectator throws any object onto the ice that in the judgment of the Referee interferes with the Player taking the “Penalty Shot” or the Goalkeeper defending the “Penalty Shot”, they shall permit the “Penalty Shot” to be taken again. For incidents involving stick measurements refer to: (Rule 10.5 Sticks Measurement) and (Rule 10.6 – Sticks Measurement – Prior to Penalty Shot) If a goal is scored from a “Penalty Shot”, the puck shall be faced-off at Center ice. If a goal is not scored, the puck shall be faced-off at either of the end Face-off Spots in the zone in which the “Penalty Shot” was attempted, except when another rule dictates the “face-off” location should be in an alternate location, such as when the “point men” enter the zone beyond the outer edge of the End-Zone Face-off Circle or when the attacking Team has been penalized on the same play. (Rule 76.2 – Face-off Locations) Should a goal be scored from a “Penalty Shot”, a further penalty to the offending Player shall not be applied unless the offense for which the “Penalty Shot” was awarded is a Major or Misconduct Penalty, in which case the appropriate penalty shall be imposed. If the offense for which the “Penalty Shot” was awarded would normally incur a Minor Penalty, then regardless of the outcome of the “Penalty Shot”, no further Minor Penalty shall be served. If the offense for which the “Penalty Shot” was awarded was to incur a Double-minor Penalty, or where the offending Team is assessed an additional Minor Penalty on the same play, the first Minor Penalty is not assessed since the “Penalty Shot” was awarded to restore the lost scoring opportunity.The second Minor Penalty would be assessed and served regardless of whether the “Penalty Shot” results in a goal. This will be announced as a Double-minor Penalty for the appropriate infraction and the Player will serve two (2) minutes only. No penalty shall expire when a goal is scored against a Team on a “Penalty Shot”. Should two (2) “Penalty Shots” be awarded to the same Team at the same stoppage of play (two (2) separate infractions), only one (1) goal can be scored or awarded at a single stoppage of play. Should the first “Penalty Shot” result in a goal, the second “Penalty Shot” would not be taken but the appropriate penalty would be assessed and served for the infraction committed. If the infraction upon which the “Penalty Shot” is based occurs during actual playing time, the “Penalty Shot” shall be awarded and taken immediately in the usual manner notwithstanding any delay occasioned by a slow whistle by the Referee to allow play to continue until the attacking side has lost possession of the puck to the defending side, to which this delay results in the expiry of the regular playing time in any period. The time required for the taking of a “Penalty Shot” shall not be included in the regular playing time or Overtime. When a Player, in the Neutral or Attacking Zone, in “control” of the puck (or who could have obtained “possession and control” of the puck) and having no other opponent to pass than the Goalkeeper, is fouled from behind, thus preventing a reasonable scoring opportunity, a “Penalty Shot” shall be awarded to the non-offending Team. Nevertheless, the Referee shall not stop play until the attacking Team has “lost possession” of the puck to the defending Team. The intention of this rule is to restore a reasonable “scoring opportunity” which has been lost. If, however, the Player fouled is able to recover and obtain a “reasonable scoring opportunity” (or a Teammate is able to gain a reasonable scoring opportunity), no “Penalty Shot” should be awarded but the appropriate penalty should be signaled and assessed if a goal is not scored on the play. “Control of the puck” means the act of propelling the puck with the stick, hand, or feet. In order for a “Penalty Shot” to be awarded for a Player being fouled from behind, the following four (4) criteria must have been met: (I) The infraction must have taken place in the Neutral or Attacking Zone (i.e., over the puck carrier’s own Blue Line); (II) The infraction must have been committed from behind (except a foul committed from the front by the Goalkeeper on a “breakaway” situation); (III) The Player in “possession and control” (or, in the judgment of the Referee, the Player clearly would have “obtained possession and control” of the puck) must have been denied a reasonable chance to score. The fact that the Player got a shot off does not automatically eliminate this play from the “Penalty Shot” consideration criteria. If the infraction was from behind and the Player was denied a “more reasonable scoring opportunity” due to the infraction, then the “Penalty Shot” should still be awarded; (IV) The Player in “possession and control” (or, in the judgment of the Referee, the Player clearly would have “obtained possession and control”) must have had no opposing Player between themself and the Goalkeeper. If, in the opinion of the Referee, a Player makes contact with the puck first and subsequently trips the opponent in so doing, no “Penalty Shot” will be awarded, but a Minor Penalty for “tripping” shall be assessed. It should be noted that if the attacking Player manages to get around the Goalkeeper and has no defending Player between them and the “open goal”, and they are fouled from behind by the Goalkeeper or another defending Player, no goal can be awarded since the Goalkeeper is still on the ice. A “Penalty Shot” would be awarded.A Minor Penalty shall be imposed on a Player who impedes the progress of an opponent by “hooking” with their stick. A Minor Penalty for “hooking” shall be assessed to any Player who uses the shaft of the stick above the upper hand to hold or hook an opponent.The Referee, at their discretion, may assess a Major Penalty and an automatic Game Misconduct Penalty to a Player guilty of “hooking” an opponent, and who recklessly endangers the fouled Player in a way that at the discretion of the Referee such Player would not be sufficiently sanctioned by imposing a Minor Penalty.This rule is described under (Rule 25 – Awarded Goal)When a Player, in the Neutral or Attacking Zone, in “control” of the puck (or who could have obtained “possession and control” of the puck) and having no other opponent to pass than the Goalkeeper, is fouled from behind, thus preventing a reasonable scoring opportunity, a “Penalty Shot” shall be awarded to the non-offending Team. Nevertheless, the Referee shall not stop play until the attacking Team has “lost possession” of the puck to the defending Team. The intention of this rule is to restore a reasonable “scoring opportunity” which has been lost. If, however, the Player fouled is able to recover and obtain a “reasonable scoring opportunity” (or a Teammate is able to gain a reasonable scoring opportunity), no “Penalty Shot” should be awarded but the appropriate penalty should be signaled and assessed if a goal is not scored on the play. “Control of the puck” means the act of propelling the puck with the stick, hand, or feet. In order for a “Penalty Shot” to be awarded for a Player being fouled from behind, the following four (4) criteria must have been met: (I) The infraction must have taken place in the Neutral or Attacking Zone (i.e., over the puck carrier’s own Blue Line); (II) The infraction must have been committed from behind (except a foul committed from the front by the Goalkeeper on a “breakaway” situation); (III) The Player in “possession and control” (or, in the judgment of the Referee, the Player clearly would have “obtained possession and control” of the puck) must have been denied a reasonable chance to score.

It should be noted that if the attacking Player manages to get around the Goalkeeper and has no defending Player between them and the “open goal”, and they are fouled from behind by the Goalkeeper or another defending Player, no goal can be awarded since the Goalkeeper is still on the ice. A “Penalty Shot” would be awarded.",

A Player who has “lost” or has “broken their stick” may receive a replacement stick by having one handed to them from their own Players’ Bench, by having one handed to them by a Teammate on the ice or by picking up their own unbroken stick or that of a Teammate from the ice. A Player will be penalized if they throw, toss, slide or shoot a stick to a Teammate (Skater) on the ice, or if they pick up and play with an opponent’s stick. A Player may not participate in the play using a Goalkeeper’s stick. A Minor Penalty shall be imposed for an infraction of this rule.

This rule is described under (Rule 24.8 – Infractions) This rule is described under (Rule 25 – Awarded Goal) Hooking is the act of using the stick in a manner that enables a Player to restrain an opponent. If the stick goes against the opponent’s hands / or near the opponent’s hands, it shall be penalized as “hooking”. When a Player is checking another in such a way that there is only stick-to-stick contact, such action is not to be penalized as “hooking”. A Minor Penalty shall be imposed on a Player who impedes the progress of an opponent by “hooking” with their stick. A Minor Penalty for “hooking” shall be assessed to any Player who uses the shaft of the stick above the upper hand to hold or hook an opponent. The Referee, at their discretion, may assess a Major Penalty and an automatic Game Misconduct Penalty to a Player guilty of “hooking” an opponent, and who recklessly endangers the fouled Player in a way that at the discretion of the Referee such Player would not be sufficiently sanctioned by imposing a Minor Penalty. This rule is described under (Rule 24.8 – Infractions) This rule is described under (Rule 25 – Awarded Goal) If deemed appropriate, Supplementary Discipline can be applied by the Proper Authorities at their discretion.

However, a Player is permitted “accidental contact” on an opponent if the act is committed as a normal “windup or follow through” of a “shooting motion”, or “accidental contact” on the opposing center who is bent over during the course of a “face-off”. A wild swing at a bouncing puck would not be considered a normal “windup or follow through” and any contact to an opponent above the height of the shoulders shall be penalized accordingly. For situations involving “high-sticking the puck”: (Rule 80 – High-sticking the Puck)When a Player is injured or compelled to leave the ice during a Game, they may retire from the Game and be replaced by a substitute, but play must continue without the Teams leaving the ice. During the play, if an injured Player wishes to retire from the ice and be replaced by a substitute, they must do so at the Players’ Bench and not through any other exit leading from the Rink. This is not a legal Player change and therefore when a violation occurs, a Bench-minor Penalty shall be imposed. If a penalized Player has been injured, they may proceed to the Dressing Room without taking a seat in the Penalty Box. The penalized Team shall immediately put a substitute Player in the Penalty Box, who shall serve the penalty until the injured Player is able to return to the game. They would replace their Teammate in the Penalty Box at the next stoppage of play. For violation of this rule, a Bench Minor Penalty shall be imposed. Should the injured penalized Player who has been replaced in the Penalty Box return to their Players’ Bench prior to the expiration of their penalty, they shall not be eligible to play until their penalty has expired. This includes coincidental penalties when their substitute is still in the Penalty Box awaiting a stoppage in play. The injured Player must wait until their substitute has been released from the Penalty Box before they are eligible to play. If, however, there is a stoppage of play prior to the expiration of their penalty, they must then replace their Teammate in the Penalty Box and is then eligible to return once their penalty has expired. When a Player is injured so that they cannot continue play or go to their Players’ Bench, the play shall not be stopped until the injured Player’s Team has secured control of the puck. If the Player’s Team is in “control of the puck” at the time of injury, play shall be stopped immediately unless their Team is in a scoring position. In the case where it is obvious that a Player has sustained a serious injury, the Referee and/or Linesperson may stop the play immediately. Where an injury has occurred to a Player and there is a stoppage of play, a Team Doctor (or other Medical Personnel) may go onto the ice to attend to the injured Player without waiting for the Referee’s consent. When play has been stopped by the Referee or Linesperson due to an injured Player, or whenever an injured Player is attended to on the ice by the Coach or Medical Personnel, such Player must be substituted for immediately. This injured Player cannot return to the ice until play has resumed. When play is stopped for an injured Player, the ensuing “face-off” shall be conducted at the Face-off Spot in the zone nearest the location of the puck when the play was stopped. When the injured Player’s Team has control of the puck in the Attacking Zone, the “face-off” shall be conducted at the nearest Faceoff Spot in the Neutral Zone. When the injured Player is in their Defending Zone and the attacking Team is in “possession of the puck” in the Attacking Zone, the “face-off” shall be conducted at the nearest Face-off Spot in the defending Team’s zone. A player who lies on the ice either feigning an injury or refusing to get up off the ice will be issued a Minor Penalty.",

When a Player discards the broken portion of a stick or some other object by tossing it or shooting it to the side of the ice (and not over the Boards) in such a way as to not interfere with the play or opposing Player(s), no penalty will be imposed for so doing.

This shot shall be taken by any Player of the non-offending Team. If a Player on a breakaway in the Neutral or Attacking Zone is interfered with by a stick or any other object or piece of equipment that is thrown by any member of the defending Team, including the Coach or any team personnel, the Referee shall award a “Penalty Shot” to the non-offending Team. (Rule 24.8 – Infractions) If a Player on a “breakaway” in the Neutral or Attacking Zone is interfered with by an object thrown on the ice by a spectator that causes them to lose possession of the puck or to fall, the Referee shall award a “Penalty Shot” to the non-offending Team.If, when the opposing Goalkeeper has been removed, a member of the defending Team, including the Coach or any team personnel, throws or shoots any part of a stick or any other object or piece of equipment at the puck or puck carrier in the Neutral or their own Defending Zone, thereby preventing the puck carrier from having a “clear shot” on an “open net”, a goal shall be awarded to the attacking side. For the purpose of this rule, an “open net” is defined as one from which a Goalkeeper has been removed for an additional attacking Player. The Goalkeeper is considered off the ice once the replacement Player has entered the Playing Surface.When a Player carries or holds any part of their stick above the shoulders and makes contact with their opponent’s neck, face or head so that “injury results”, in the manner of drawing blood or otherwise, the Referee shall assess a Double-minor Penalty. Referees making this call shall have the option (but not the obligation) to review video of the play for the purpose of confirming (or not) their original call on the ice, and, in particular, whether the stick causing the apparent injury was actually the stick of the Player being penalized. (Rule 18.4 – On-ice Video Review of Double-minor Penalties for High-sticking)A Minor Penalty for “Unsportsmanlike Conduct” shall be assessed under this rule for the following infractions: (I) Any identifiable Player who uses obscene, profane or abusive language or gestures directed at any person.

If the altercation never materializes, the Player shall receive a Minor Penalty for “Unsportsmanlike Conduct” and a ten-minute (10) Misconduct Penalty for deliberately removing their jersey.

Regarding to a Goalkeeper, this rule applies outside of their Goal Crease area; (II) On any Player who deliberately shoots or bats (using their hand or stick) the puck outside the playing area (from anywhere on the ice surface) during the play or after a stoppage of play; (III) On any Player who shoots or bats (using their hand or stick) the puck directly (non-deflected) out of the playing surface from their Defending Zone, except where there is no Protective Glass. The determining factor shall be the position of the puck when it was shot or batted by the offending Player. If contact with the puck occurs while the puck is inside the Defending Zone, and subsequently goes out of play, the Minor Penalty shall be assessed. When the puck is shot over the Protective Glass surrounding the Players’ Bench, the penalty will be assessed. Note: When the puck is shot into the Players’ Bench, the penalty will not apply. When the puck goes out of the playing area directly off a “face-off”, no penalty shall be assessed; (IV) On any Player who delays the game by deliberately displacing a Goal Post from its normal position. The Referee shall stop play immediately when the offending Team gains “control” of the puck. Note: If a Player deliberately displaces a Goal Post from its normal position when an opponent has an imminent scoring opportunity on an open net, a goal may be awarded by the Referee (Rule 63.7 – Awarded Goal) (V) On a Player other than the Goalkeeper who deliberately falls on or gathers the puck into their body; Note: Any Player who drops to their knees to block a shot should not be penalized if the puck is shot under them or becomes lodged in their clothing or equipment but any use of the hands to make the puck unplayable should be penalized promptly; (VI) On a Goalkeeper who “races out” of their Goal Crease in an attempt to beat the attacking Player to the puck and instead of playing the puck jumps on the puck causing a stoppage of play; Note: If a Goalkeeper comes out of their Goal Crease to “cut down the angle” on a shot and after making the save covers the puck, this shall be legal. (VII) On a Goalkeeper who, when they are in their own Goal Crease, deliberately falls on or gathers the puck into their body or who holds or places the puck against any part of the goal in such a manner as to cause a stoppage of play unless they are actually being checked by an opponent; (VIII) On a Goalkeeper who plays the puck outside of the Designated Area behind the net. The determining factor shall be the position of the puck. Note: The Minor Penalty will not be assessed when a Goalkeeper plays the puck while maintaining skate contact with the Goal Crease. (IX) For adjustments to clothing, equipment, skates, or sticks. Note: No penalty should be assessed when a water bottle is delivered to a Goalkeeper, however, this should be conducted during time-outs and if, in the opinion of the Referee, it is being done to intentionally delay the game, a Minor Penalty may be assessed. (X) No delay shall be permitted for the repair or adjustment of Goalkeeper’s equipment. If adjustments are required, the Goalkeeper shall leave the ice and their place shall be taken by the substitute Goalkeeper immediately. For an infraction of this rule by a Goalkeeper, a Minor Penalty shall be imposed.",

Before the goalkeeper has time to get back to defend the goal, Team B is pressing with many shots as Team A defensive player A7 is standing in the goal crease blocking shots.

(VII) On a Goalkeeper who, when they are in their own Goal Crease, deliberately falls on or gathers the puck into their body or who holds or places the puck against any part of the goal in such a manner as to cause a stoppage of play unless they are actually being checked by an opponent; (VIII) On a Goalkeeper who plays the puck outside of the Designated Area behind the net. The determining factor shall be the position of the puck. Note: The Minor Penalty will not be assessed when a Goalkeeper plays the puck while maintaining skate contact with the Goal Crease. (IX) For adjustments to clothing, equipment, skates, or sticks. Note: No penalty should be assessed when a water bottle is delivered to a Goalkeeper, however, this should be conducted during time-outs and if, in the opinion of the Referee, it is being done to intentionally delay the game, a Minor Penalty may be assessed.

In order to award a goal in this situation, the Goal Post must have been displaced by the actions of a defending Player, the attacking Player must have “an imminent scoring opportunity” prior to the Goal Post being displaced, and it must be determined that the puck would have entered the Goal between the normal position of the Goal Posts. If the Goal Post is deliberately displaced by a Goalkeeper during the course of a “break-away,” a goal will be awarded to the nonoffending Team. When the Goal Post has been displaced deliberately by the defending Team when their Goalkeeper has been removed for an extra attacker thereby preventing an impending goal by the attacking Team, the Referee shall award a goal to the attacking Team. The goal frame is considered to be displaced if either or both goal pegs are no longer in their respective holes in the ice, or the net has come completely off one or both pegs, prior to or as the puck enters the goal.A Minor Penalty for “Delay of Game” shall be assessed: (I) On any Player, including the Goalkeeper, who holds, “freezes” or plays the puck with their stick, skates or body in such a manner as to deliberately cause a stoppage of play. Regarding to a Goalkeeper, this rule applies outside of their Goal Crease area; (II) On any Player who deliberately shoots or bats (using their hand or stick) the puck outside the playing area (from anywhere on the ice surface) during the play or after a stoppage of play; (III) On any Player who shoots or bats (using their hand or stick) the puck directly (non-deflected) out of the playing surface from their Defending Zone, except where there is no Protective Glass. The determining factor shall be the position of the puck when it was shot or batted by the offending Player. If contact with the puck occurs while the puck is inside the Defending Zone, and subsequently goes out of play, the Minor Penalty shall be assessed. When the puck is shot over the Protective Glass surrounding the Players’ Bench, the penalty will be assessed. Note: When the puck is shot into the Players’ Bench, the penalty will not apply. When the puck goes out of the playing area directly off a “face-off”, no penalty shall be assessed; (IV) On any Player who delays the game by deliberately displacing a Goal Post from its normal position. The Referee shall stop play immediately when the offending Team gains “control” of the puck. Note: If a Player deliberately displaces a Goal Post from its normal position when an opponent has an imminent scoring opportunity on an open net, a goal may be awarded by the Referee (Rule 63.7 – Awarded Goal) (V) On a Player other than the Goalkeeper who deliberately falls on or gathers the puck into their body; Note: Any Player who drops to their knees to block a shot should not be penalized if the puck is shot under them or becomes lodged in their clothing or equipment but any use of the hands to make the puck unplayable should be penalized promptly; (VI) On a Goalkeeper who “races out” of their Goal Crease in an attempt to beat the attacking Player to the puck and instead of playing the puck jumps on the puck causing a stoppage of play; Note: If a Goalkeeper comes out of their Goal Crease to “cut down the angle” on a shot and after making the save covers the puck, this shall be legal. (VII) On a Goalkeeper who, when they are in their own Goal Crease, deliberately falls on or gathers the puck into their body or who holds or places the puck against any part of the goal in such a manner as to cause a stoppage of play unless they are actually being checked by an opponent; (VIII) On a Goalkeeper who plays the puck outside of the Designated Area behind the net. The determining factor shall be the position of the puck. Note: The Minor Penalty will not be assessed when a Goalkeeper plays the puck while maintaining skate contact with the Goal Crease. (IX) For adjustments to clothing, equipment, skates, or sticks. Note: No penalty should be assessed when a water bottle is delivered to a Goalkeeper, however, this should be conducted during time-outs and if, in the opinion of the Referee, it is being done to intentionally delay the game, a Minor Penalty may be assessed. (X) No delay shall be permitted for the repair or adjustment of Goalkeeper’s equipment.

If two (2) rule violations are the reason for the stoppage of play (e.g.: “high-sticking the puck” and “intentional off-side”), the ensuing “face-off location” shall be determined as the spot that provides the least amount of “territorial advantage” to the offending Team. When the play is stopped for any reason not specifically attributable to either Team while the puck is in the Neutral Zone, the ensuing “face-off” shall be conducted at the nearest Face-off Spot outside the Blue Line whenever possible. When it is unclear as to which of the four (4) Face-off Spots is the nearest, the spot that gives the Home Team the greatest “territorial advantage” in the Neutral Zone will be selected for the ensuing “face-off”. When Players are penalized at a stoppage of play so as to result in penalties being placed on the penalty time clock to one Team, the ensuing “face-off” shall be conducted at one of the two (2) Face-off Spots in the offending Team’s Defending Zone. There are only three (3) exceptions to this application: (I) when a penalty is assessed after the scoring of a goal – “face-off” shall be conducted at Center ice; (II) when a penalty is assessed at the end (or start) of a period – “face-off” shall be conducted at Center ice; (III) or when the defending Team is penalized, and the attacking Players enter the Attacking Zone beyond the outer edge of the End Zone Face-off Circle – “face-off” shall be conducted in the Neutral Zone. The Team awarded the “Power-Play” will have the choice of which End Zone spot the “face-off” will take place at to start the “Power-Play”. When an infringement of a rule has been committed by Players of both Teams in the play resulting in the stoppage, the ensuing “face-off” will be conducted at the nearest Face-off Spot in that zone. When stoppage occurs between the end Face-off Spots and near end of the Rink, the puck shall be faced-off at the end Face-off Spot on the side where the stoppage occurs unless otherwise expressly provided by these rules. No “face-off” shall be made within 4.50 m of the goal or side Boards nor anywhere other than at a Face-off Spot. When a goal is illegally scored as a result of a puck being deflected directly off an Official, the resulting “face-off” shall be made at the nearest Face-off Spot in the zone where the puck deflected off of the Official. When a goal is illegally scored by the attacking Team by “directing”, “batting”, “kicking” or “high-sticking” the puck into the goal, the resulting “face-off” shall take place in the Neutral Zone at the nearest Face-off Spot. When the game is stopped for any reason not specifically covered in the official rules, the puck must be “faced-off” at a Face-off Spot in the zone nearest to where it was last played. Following a stoppage of play, should one or both defensemen who are the “point Players” or any Player coming from the Players’ Bench of the attacking Team, enter into the Attacking Zone beyond the outer edge of the End Zone Face-off Circle during an altercation, “gathering or scrum”, the ensuing “face-off” shall take place in the Neutral Zone near the Blue Line of the defending Team. This rule also applies when an “icing”, an “intentional off-side”, or a penalty has been assessed, and the ensuing “face-off” is to be in the offending Team’s Defending Zone. Should any of the non-offending Players enter the Attacking Zone beyond the outer edge of the End Zone Face-off Circle during an altercation, “gathering or scrum”, the ensuing “face-off” shall take place in the Neutral Zone near the Blue Line of the defending Team. For a violation of (Rule 71 – Premature Substitution) the resulting “face-off” will take place at the Center ice Face-off Spot when play is stopped beyond the Center red line. When play is stopped prior to the Center red line, the resulting “face-off” shall be conducted at the nearest Face-off Spot in the zone where the play was stopped. When play is stopped for an injured Player, the ensuing “face-off” shall be conducted at the Face-off Spot in the zone nearest the location of the puck when the play was stopped. When the injured Player’s Team has “control of the puck” in the Attacking Zone, the “face-off” shall be conducted at one of the Face-off Spots outside the Blue Line in the Neutral Zone. When the injured Player is in their Defending Zone and the attacking Team is in “control of the puck” in the Attacking Zone, the “face-off” shall be conducted at one of the defending Team’s end-zone Face-off Spots.When a puck goes outside the playing area at either end or either side of the Rink, strikes any obstacles above the playing surface other than the Boards or Protective Glass, causes the glass, lighting, timing device or the supports to break, it shall be “faced-off” at the nearest Face-off Spot in the zone from where it was shot or deflected out of play. Should the On-ice Officials rule that the shot or deflection that caused the puck to go out of play originated from the neutral or Defending Zones, the resulting “face-off” location shall be the nearest Face-off Spot closest to the origin of the shot or deflection that gives the offending Team the least amount of “territorial advantage”. If the puck comes to rest on top of the Boards surrounding the playing area, it shall be considered to be in play and may be played legally by hand or stick. When the puck goes outside the playing area directly off the “face-off”, regardless as to which Player may have last contacted the puck, the “face-off” shall remain in the same spot and no penalty will be assessed to either Team for delaying the game. When the puck is shot and it makes contact with the gloves or the body of a Player hanging over the Players’ Bench, or if the puck enters the Players’ Bench through an open bench door, the “face-off” shall take place at the nearest Face-off Spot in the zone from where the puck was shot, however, if the puck hits an opposing Player’s glove or body that is hanging over the opposing Team’s Players’ Bench or enters the opposing Team’s Players’ Bench through an open bench door, the “face-off” shall take place in the Neutral Zone adjacent to the opponent’s Players’ Bench. Should the puck strike the curved glass located at the end of either Players’ Bench, play shall be stopped when observed by any of the On-ice Officials. The ensuing “face-off” shall be determined as if the puck went outside the playing area. Should the puck strike the spectator netting at the ends and the corners of the arena, play shall be stopped, and the ensuing “faceoff” shall be determined as if the puck went outside the playing area. Players must not stop playing the game until they hear the whistle to do so.",

Regarding to a Goalkeeper, this rule applies outside of their Goal Crease area; (II) On any Player who deliberately shoots or bats (using their hand or stick) the puck outside the playing area (from anywhere on the ice surface) during the play or after a stoppage of play; (III) On any Player who shoots or bats (using their hand or stick) the puck directly (non-deflected) out of the playing surface from their Defending Zone, except where there is no Protective Glass. The determining factor shall be the position of the puck when it was shot or batted by the offending Player. If contact with the puck occurs while the puck is inside the Defending Zone, and subsequently goes out of play, the Minor Penalty shall be assessed. When the puck is shot over the Protective Glass surrounding the Players’ Bench, the penalty will be assessed. Note: When the puck is shot into the Players’ Bench, the penalty will not apply. When the puck goes out of the playing area directly off a “face-off”, no penalty shall be assessed; (IV) On any Player who delays the game by deliberately displacing a Goal Post from its normal position. The Referee shall stop play immediately when the offending Team gains “control” of the puck. Note: If a Player deliberately displaces a Goal Post from its normal position when an opponent has an imminent scoring opportunity on an open net, a goal may be awarded by the Referee (Rule 63.7 – Awarded Goal) (V) On a Player other than the Goalkeeper who deliberately falls on or gathers the puck into their body; Note: Any Player who drops to their knees to block a shot should not be penalized if the puck is shot under them or becomes lodged in their clothing or equipment but any use of the hands to make the puck unplayable should be penalized promptly; (VI) On a Goalkeeper who “races out” of their Goal Crease in an attempt to beat the attacking Player to the puck and instead of playing the puck jumps on the puck causing a stoppage of play; Note: If a Goalkeeper comes out of their Goal Crease to “cut down the angle” on a shot and after making the save covers the puck, this shall be legal. (VII) On a Goalkeeper who, when they are in their own Goal Crease, deliberately falls on or gathers the puck into their body or who holds or places the puck against any part of the goal in such a manner as to cause a stoppage of play unless they are actually being checked by an opponent; (VIII) On a Goalkeeper who plays the puck outside of the Designated Area behind the net. The determining factor shall be the position of the puck. Note: The Minor Penalty will not be assessed when a Goalkeeper plays the puck while maintaining skate contact with the Goal Crease. (IX) For adjustments to clothing, equipment, skates, or sticks. Note: No penalty should be assessed when a water bottle is delivered to a Goalkeeper, however, this should be conducted during time-outs and if, in the opinion of the Referee, it is being done to intentionally delay the game, a Minor Penalty may be assessed. (X) No delay shall be permitted for the repair or adjustment of Goalkeeper’s equipment. If adjustments are required, the Goalkeeper shall leave the ice and their place shall be taken by the substitute Goalkeeper immediately. For an infraction of this rule by a Goalkeeper, a Minor Penalty shall be imposed.If by reason of insufficient time in the regular playing time or by reason of penalties already imposed, the Minor Penalty assessed to a Player for deliberately displacing their own Goal Post cannot be served in its entirety within the regular playing time of the game or at any time in Overtime, a “Penalty Shot” shall be awarded against the offending Team. No defending Player, except the Goalkeeper, will be permitted to fall on the puck, hold the puck, pick up the puck, or gather the puck into the body or hands when the puck is within the Goal Crease. For infringement of this rule, play shall immediately be stopped and a “Penalty Shot” shall be ordered against the offending Team, but no other penalty shall be given. The rule shall be interpreted so that a “Penalty Shot” will be awarded only when the puck is in the Goal Crease at the instant the offense occurs. However, in cases where the puck is outside the Goal Crease, Rule 63 may still apply and a Minor Penalty may be imposed, even though no “Penalty Shot” is awarded. The significant factor when determining whether or not a “Penalty Shot” is warranted is the location of the puck at the time it was held, grabbed or gathered into the body. If the puck is in the Goal Crease, a “Penalty Shot” shall be awarded. If the puck is outside the Goal Crease and gathered into the body of a Player (other than the Goalkeeper) who is inside the Goal Crease, a Minor Penalty shall be assessed.",

The Referee blows the whistle and proceeds to assess the goalkeeper a minor penalty for delay of game.

There is a huddle amongst the officials and they decide to take the penalty away, with the ensuing face-off in the Team A end zone and play resumes with Team A still on the power play.

During the play, if an injured Player wishes to retire from the ice and be replaced by a substitute, they must do so at the Players’ Bench and not through any other exit leading from the Rink. This is not a legal Player change and therefore when a violation occurs, a Bench-minor Penalty shall be imposed. If a penalized Player has been injured, they may proceed to the Dressing Room without taking a seat in the Penalty Box. The penalized Team shall immediately put a substitute Player in the Penalty Box, who shall serve the penalty until the injured Player is able to return to the game. They would replace their Teammate in the Penalty Box at the next stoppage of play. For violation of this rule, a Bench Minor Penalty shall be imposed. Should the injured penalized Player who has been replaced in the Penalty Box return to their Players’ Bench prior to the expiration of their penalty, they shall not be eligible to play until their penalty has expired. This includes coincidental penalties when their substitute is still in the Penalty Box awaiting a stoppage in play. The injured Player must wait until their substitute has been released from the Penalty Box before they are eligible to play. If, however, there is a stoppage of play prior to the expiration of their penalty, they must then replace their Teammate in the Penalty Box and is then eligible to return once their penalty has expired. When a Player is injured so that they cannot continue play or go to their Players’ Bench, the play shall not be stopped until the injured Player’s Team has secured control of the puck. If the Player’s Team is in “control of the puck” at the time of injury, play shall be stopped immediately unless their Team is in a scoring position. In the case where it is obvious that a Player has sustained a serious injury, the Referee and/or Linesperson may stop the play immediately. Where an injury has occurred to a Player and there is a stoppage of play, a Team Doctor (or other Medical Personnel) may go onto the ice to attend to the injured Player without waiting for the Referee’s consent. When play has been stopped by the Referee or Linesperson due to an injured Player, or whenever an injured Player is attended to on the ice by the Coach or Medical Personnel, such Player must be substituted for immediately. This injured Player cannot return to the ice until play has resumed. When play is stopped for an injured Player, the ensuing “face-off” shall be conducted at the Face-off Spot in the zone nearest the location of the puck when the play was stopped. When the injured Player’s Team has control of the puck in the Attacking Zone, the “face-off” shall be conducted at the nearest Faceoff Spot in the Neutral Zone. When the injured Player is in their Defending Zone and the attacking Team is in “possession of the puck” in the Attacking Zone, the “face-off” shall be conducted at the nearest Face-off Spot in the defending Team’s zone. A player who lies on the ice either feigning an injury or refusing to get up off the ice will be issued a Minor Penalty.An “illegal substitution” shall be deemed to have occurred when a Player enters the game illegally from either the Players’ Bench (Teammate not within the 1.50 m limit (Rule 74 – Too Many Players) on the Ice, from the Penalty Box (penalty has not yet expired), when a Major Penalty is being served and the replacement Player does not return to the ice from the Penalty Box (Rule 68.2 – Bench Minor Penalty) or when a Player illegally enters the game for the sole purpose of preventing an opposing Player from scoring on a “breakaway” (Rule 68.3 – Penalty Shot) or (Rule 68.4 – Awarded Goal) When an injured Player is penalized and leaves the game, if they return before the expiration of their penalty, they are not eligible to play. This includes Coincidental Penalties when their substitute is still in the Penalty Box awaiting a stoppage in play. The injured Player must wait until their substitute has been released from the Penalty Box before they are eligible to play. (Rule 8.1 – Injured Players)Apparent goals shall be disallowed by the Referee and the appropriate announcement made by the Public Address Announcer for the following reasons: (I) When the puck has been directed with any part of their body (excl. skates), batted or thrown into the net by an attacking Player other than with a stick. When this occurs, if it is deemed to be done deliberately, then the decision shall be NO GOAL. A goal cannot be scored when the puck has been deliberately batted with any part of the attacking Player’s body into the net (Rule 78.4 – Scoring a Goal) (II) When the puck has been kicked using a distinct kicking motion (Rule 49.2 – Kicking) (III) When the puck has deflected directly into the net off an official (Rule 85.4 – Puck Striking Official) (IV) When a goal has been scored and an ineligible Player is on the ice (Rule 68.5 – Disallowed Goal) (V) When an attacking Player has interfered with a Goalkeeper in their Goal Crease (Rule 69.1 – Interference on the Goalkeeper) (VI) When the puck has entered the net after making contact with an attacking Player’s stick that is above the height of the crossbar. Where the puck makes contact with the stick is the determining factor (Rule 80.3 – Disallowed Goal) (VII) When Video Review confirms the scoring of a goal at one end of the ice, any goal scored at the other end on the same play must be disallowed (Rule 37.2 – Video Review) (VIII) When a Linesperson reports a Double-minor Penalty for high-sticking or a Major Penalty to the Referee following the scoring of a goal by the offending Team, the goal must be disallowed, and the appropriate penalty assessed (Rule 32.4 – Reporting to Referee) (IX) When a Goalkeeper has been pushed into the net together with the puck after making a save (Rule 69.7 – Rebounds and Loose Pucks) (X) When the net becomes displaced accidentally. The goal frame is considered to be displaced if either or both goal pegs are no longer in their respective holes in the ice, or the net has come completely off one or both pegs, prior to or as the puck enters the goal. However, if this occurs as a result of the actions of a defending player, refer to (Rule 63.7 – Awarded Goal) (XI) During the delayed calling of a penalty, the offending Team cannot score unless the non-offending Team shoots the puck into their own net. This shall mean that a deflection off an offending Player or any physical action by an offending Player that may cause the puck to enter the non-offending Team’s goal, shall not be considered a legal goal. Play shall be stopped before the puck enters the net (whenever possible) and the signaled penalty assessed to the offending Team; (XII) When the Referee deems the play has been stopped, even if they have not physically had the opportunity to stop play by blowing their whistle; (XIII) Any goal scored, other than as covered by the official rules, shall not be allowed.",

                    "context": "This rule is described under: (Rule 70.9 Disallowed goal)Except at the end of each period or on expiration of their penalty, no Player may, at any time, leave the Penalty Box. A Player serving a penalty in the Penalty Box, who is to be changed after the penalty has been served, must proceed at once by way of the ice and be at their own Players’ Bench before any change can be made.For any violation of this rule, a Bench Minor Penalty shall be imposed for “too many Players on the ice”. (Rule 74 – Too many Players on the Ice) A penalized Player who leaves the Penalty Box before their penalty has expired, whether play is in progress or not, shall incur an additional Minor Penalty after serving their unexpired penalty. Any Player who, having entered the Penalty Box, leaves the Penalty Box prior to the expiration of their penalty for the purpose of challenging an Official’s ruling, shall be assessed a Game Misconduct Penalty. If deemed appropriate, Supplementary Discipline can be applied by the Proper Authorities at their discretion. This rule does not replace any other more severe penalty that may be imposed for leaving the Penalty Box for the purpose of starting or participating in an altercation as outlined in this rule. (Rule 28 – Supplementary Discipline) Any penalized Player leaving the Penalty Box during a stoppage of play and during an altercation shall incur a Minor Penalty plus a Game Misconduct Penalty. The Minor Penalty plus the unexpired time remaining in their original penalty must be served by a replacement Player placed in the Penalty Box by the Coach of the offending Team. If a Player leaves the Penalty Box before their penalty is fully served, the Penalty Timekeeper shall note the time and signal the On-ice Officials who will stop play when the offending Player’s Team obtains “control of the puck”. An additional Minor Penalty must be served by this Player in addition to the time remaining in their original penalty (this unexpired time is calculated from the time they left the Penalty Box illegally). In the case of a Player returning to the ice before their time has expired through an error of the Penalty Timekeeper, they are not to serve an additional penalty, but must serve their unexpired time this unexpired time is calculated from the time they left the Penalty Box through the error of the Penalty Timekeeper. At a stoppage of play following the expiration of their penalties, if a Player or Players exiting the Penalty Box get involved in an altercation, those coming from the Penalty Box shall be assessed the penalties they incur in the altercation. Should a Player coming from the Penalty Box at a stoppage of play get involved with an opponent and the opponent is deemed to be the instigator of the altercation, then the Player coming from the Penalty Box would not be subject to the Game Misconduct Penalty. If deemed appropriate, Supplementary Discipline can be applied by the Proper Authorities at their discretion. (Rule 28 – Supplementary Discipline)The Penalty Timekeeper shall keep a correct record of all penalties imposed by the On-ice Game Officials, including the names of the Players penalized, the penalties assessed, the duration of each penalty and the time at which each penalty was imposed. This information shall also be recorded by the scorekeeper on the Official Game Sheet. The Penalty Timekeeper shall inform penalized Players and the Penalty Box Attendants as to the correct expiration time of all penalties. In the event of a malfunction of the Penalty Time Clock, the Game Clock shall be utilized to determine the expiration time of each penalty. Otherwise, the Penalty Time Clocks shall be the official timing device for all penalties that require a Team to play with less than five (5) Skaters. Players shall only be released from the Penalty Box when indicated by the Penalty Time Clock or as otherwise covered in the playing rules. The infraction of the rules for which each penalty has been imposed will be announced over the Public Address System as reported by the Referee. Where Players of both Teams are penalized at the same time, the penalty to the visiting Player will be announced first. In situations where multiple Game Misconduct Penalties have been assessed to any one (1) Player at the same stoppage of play, only one (1) Game Misconduct Penalty should be announced. Misconduct Penalties and coincident Major Penalties should not be recorded on the timing device (Penalty Time Clock) but such penalized Players should be alerted and released at the first stoppage of play following the expiration of their penalties. When a Player is assessed a Misconduct Penalty in addition to other penalties, the Misconduct Penalty shall only commence after all other penalties have been served (or washed out by the scoring of a goal). If a Player leaves the Penalty Box before the time has expired, the Penalty Timekeeper must note the time and notify the Referees at their first opportunity. It is the responsibility of the Penalty Timekeeper to ensure that penalized Players return to the Penalty Box before the puck is dropped for the start of a new period. In the event a penalized Player is not in the Penalty Box, the Penalty Timekeeper should notify the Referees and prevent the game from resuming until the Player is there.If a penalized Player returns to the ice from the Penalty Box before their penalty has expired by their own error or the error of the Penalty Timekeeper, any goal scored by their own Team while they are illegally on the ice shall be disallowed but all penalties imposed on either Team shall be served as regular penalties. If a Player shall illegally enter the game from their own Players’ Bench or from the Penalty Box, any goal scored by their own Team while they are illegally on the ice shall be disallowed but all penalties imposed on either Team shall be served as regular penalties.Apparent goals shall be disallowed by the Referee and the appropriate announcement made by the Public Address Announcer for the following reasons: (I) When the puck has been directed with any part of their body (excl. skates), batted or thrown into the net by an attacking Player other than with a stick. When this occurs, if it is deemed to be done deliberately, then the decision shall be NO GOAL. A goal cannot be scored when the puck has been deliberately batted with any part of the attacking Player’s body into the net (Rule 78.4 – Scoring a Goal) (II) When the puck has been kicked using a distinct kicking motion (Rule 49.2 – Kicking) (III) When the puck has deflected directly into the net off an official (Rule 85.4 – Puck Striking Official) (IV) When a goal has been scored and an ineligible Player is on the ice (Rule 68.5 – Disallowed Goal) (V) When an attacking Player has interfered with a Goalkeeper in their Goal Crease (Rule 69.1 – Interference on the Goalkeeper) (VI) When the puck has entered the net after making contact with an attacking Player’s stick that is above the height of the crossbar. Where the puck makes contact with the stick is the determining factor (Rule 80.3 – Disallowed Goal) (VII) When Video Review confirms the scoring of a goal at one end of the ice, any goal scored at the other end on the same play must be disallowed (Rule 37.2 – Video Review) (VIII) When a Linesperson reports a Double-minor Penalty for high-sticking or a Major Penalty to the Referee following the scoring of a goal by the offending Team, the goal must be disallowed, and the appropriate penalty assessed (Rule 32.4 – Reporting to Referee) (IX) When a Goalkeeper has been pushed into the net together with the puck after making a save (Rule 69.7 – Rebounds and Loose Pucks) (X) When the net becomes displaced accidentally. The goal frame is considered to be displaced if either or both goal pegs are no longer in their respective holes in the ice, or the net has come completely off one or both pegs, prior to or as the puck enters the goal. However, if this occurs as a result of the actions of a defending player, refer to (Rule 63.7 – Awarded Goal) (XI) During the delayed calling of a penalty, the offending Team cannot score unless the non-offending Team shoots the puck into their own net. This shall mean that a deflection off an offending Player or any physical action by an offending Player that may cause the puck to enter the non-offending Team’s goal, shall not be considered a legal goal. Play shall be stopped before the puck enters the net (whenever possible) and the signaled penalty assessed to the offending Team; (XII) When the Referee deems the play has been stopped, even if they have not physically had the opportunity to stop play by blowing their whistle; (XIII) Any goal scored, other than as covered by the official rules, shall not be allowed.",

Any violation of this provision shall be treated as an illegal substitution under this rule calling for a Bench Minor Penalty. It is the responsibility of the Referees to award goals and report the ”goal scorer” and “assists”, and their decision in this respect is final, notwithstanding the report of the Referee or any other Game Official. The Officials Scorekeeper, with the assistance of the Statistic staff will confirm the “goal scorer” and any Player deserving an “assist”. This decision is final in this regard and no changes can be made after the conclusion of the game. The use of video replay to verify the proper awarding of a goal or an assist is essential. Such awards shall be made or withheld strictly in accordance with the provisions of this rule. Therefore, it is essential that the Official Scorekeeper be thoroughly familiar with every aspect of this rule; be alerted to observe all actions which could affect the awarding of a goal or assist; and, above all, give or withhold awards with absolute impartiality. In case of an obvious error in awarding a goal or an assist that has been announced, it should be corrected promptly, but changes should not be made in the official scoring summary after the Referee has signed the game report. The Team scoring the greatest number of goals during the three (3) twenty-minute periods shall be the winner and shall be credited with three (3) points in the standings. In the event a winner during the Round Robin or Preliminary Round is determined in the Overtime period or the shootout, the winning Team shall be credited with two (2) points in the standings and the losing Team will be credited with one (1) point in the standings. A “goal” shall be credited in the scoring records to a Player who shall have propelled the puck into the opponent’s goal. Each “goal” shall count one point in the Player’s record. Only one point can be credited to any one Player on a goal. When a Player scores a goal, an “assist” shall be credited to the Player or Players (maximum two) who touch the puck prior to the “goal scorer” provided no defender plays or has “control of the puck” subsequently. Each “assist” shall count one point in the Player’s record. Only one point can be credited to any one Player on a goal. A goal shall be scored when the puck shall have been put between the Goal Posts by the stick of a Player of the attacking side, from in front and below the crossbar, and entirely across a red line the width of the diameter of the Goal Posts drawn on the ice from one Goal Post to the other with the goal frame in its proper position. The goal frame shall be considered in its proper position when at least a portion of the flexible peg(s) are still inside both the Goal post and the hole in the ice. The flexible pegs could be bent, but as long as at least a portion of the flexible peg(s) are still in the hole in the ice and the Goal Post, the goal frame shall be deemed to be in its proper position. The goal frame could be raised somewhat on one post (or both), but as long as the flexible pegs are still in contact with the holes in the ice and the Goal Posts, the goal frame shall not be deemed to be displaced. A goal shall be scored if the puck is shot into the goal by a Player of the defending side. The Player of the attacking side who last touched the puck shall be credited with the goal, but no assist shall be awarded. A goal shall be scored if the puck is put into the goal in any other manner by a Player of the defending side. The Player of the attacking side who last touched the puck shall be credited with the goal and assists may be awarded. If an attacking Player has the puck deflect into the net, off their skate or body, in any manner, the goal shall be allowed. The Player who deflected the puck shall be credited with the goal.

                    "context": "This rule is based on the premise that an attacking Player’s position, whether inside or outside the Goal Crease, should not, by itself, determine whether a goal should be allowed or disallowed. In other words, goals scored while attacking Players are standing in the Goal Crease may, in appropriate circumstances be allowed. Goals should be disallowed only if: (I) an attacking Player, either by their positioning or by a \"relevant contact”, impairs the Goalkeeper’s ability to move freely within their Goal Crease or defend their goal; or (II) an attacking Player initiates intentional or deliberate contact with a Goalkeeper, inside or outside of their Goal Crease. “Incidental contact” with a Goalkeeper will be permitted, and resulting goals allowed, when such contact is initiated outside of the Goal Crease, provided the attacking Player has made a reasonable effort to avoid such contact. The rule will be enforced exclusively in accordance with the on-ice judgement of the Referee(s), but may be subject to a Video Review: (Rule 37 – Video Review) when applicable or to a Coach’s Challenge (Rule 38 – Coach’s Challenge) For purposes of this rule, “contact / relevant contact” whether \"incidental or otherwise\", shall mean any contact that is made between or among a Goalkeeper and attacking Player(s), whether by means of a stick or any part of the body. The overriding rationale of this rule is that a Goalkeeper should have the ability to move freely within their Goal Crease without being hindered by the actions of an attacking Player. If an attacking Player enters the Goal Crease and, by their actions, impairs the Goalkeeper’s ability to defend their goal, and a goal is scored, the goal will be disallowed. If an attacking Player is in the Goal Crease and does not leave immediately, the Referee has the possibility to stop the game and the subsequent “face-off” shall take place at the nearest Neutral Zone Face-off Spot outside the Attacking Zone of the offending Team. If an attacking Player has been pushed, shoved, or fouled by a defending Player so as to cause them to come into contact with the Goalkeeper, such contact will not be deemed contact initiated by the attacking Player for purposes of this rule, provided the attacking Player has made a reasonable effort to avoid such contact. If a defending Player has been pushed, shoved, or fouled by an attacking Player so as to cause the defending Player to come into contact with their own Goalkeeper, such contact shall be deemed contact initiated by the attacking Player for purposes of this rule, and if necessary, a penalty assessed to the attacking Player and if a goal is scored it would be disallowed.If an attacking Player initiates \"a relevant contact\" with a Goalkeeper, incidental or otherwise, while the Goalkeeper is in their Goal Crease, and a goal is scored, the goal will be disallowed. If a Goalkeeper, in the “act of establishing their position” within their Goal Crease, initiates contact with an attacking Player who is in the Goal Crease, and this results in an impairment of the Goalkeeper’s ability to defend their goal, and a goal is scored, the goal will be disallowed. If, after any contact by a Goalkeeper who is attempting to establish position in their Goal Crease, the attacking Player does not immediately vacate their current position in the Goal Crease (i.e., give ground to the Goalkeeper), and a goal is scored, the goal will be disallowed. In all such cases, whether or not a goal is scored, the attacking Player will receive the appropriate penalty for Goalkeeper “interference”. If an attacking Player establishes a “significant position” within the Goal Crease, so as to obstruct the Goalkeeper’s vision and impair their ability to defend their goal, and a goal is scored, the goal will be disallowed. For this purpose, a Player “establishes a significant position within the crease” when, in the Referee’s judgment, their body, or a substantial portion thereof, is within the Goal Crease for more than an instantaneous period of time.",

                    "context": "A Player who obstructs or prevents an opponent “without possession of the puck” from skating, receiving a pass, or moving about the ice freely is considered as “interference”. A “late-hit” constitutes reckless endangerment of a Player who “no longer has control or possession of the puck”. Any Player who is in the process of “abandoning” or “losing control or possession of the puck” is subject to a bodycheck so long as the aggressor is in the immediate vicinity of the Skater with the puck. A strict standard on acts of interference must be adhered to in all areas of the Rink. Body Position: “Body position” shall be determined as the Player skating in front of or beside their opponent, traveling in the same direction. A Player who is behind an opponent, who does not have the puck, may not use their stick, body, or free hand in order to restrain their opponent, but must skate in order to gain or reestablish their “proper position” in order to make a check. A Player is allowed the ice they are standing on (body position) and are not required to move in order to let an opponent proceed. A Player may “block the path” of an opponent provided they are in front of their opponent and moving in the same direction. Moving laterally and without “establishing body position”, then making contact with the non-puck carrier is not permitted and will be penalized as “interference”. A Player is always entitled to use their “body position” to lengthen an opponent’s path to the puck, provided their stick is not utilized (to make themself “bigger” and therefore considerably lengthening the distance their opponent must travel to get where they are going); their “free hand” is not used, and they do not take advantage of their “body position” to deliver an otherwise illegal check. Possession of the Puck: The last Player to touch the puck, other than the Goalkeeper, shall be considered the Player in “possession”. The Player deemed in “possession” of the puck may be checked legally, provided the check is rendered immediately following them “loss of control” and their opponent still finds themself within an “objectively reasonable window of opportunity” to deliver such a check refer to Rule 56.4 – Interference . Restrain: The actions of a Player who does not have “body position”, but instead uses illegal means (e.g., “hook” with stick; “hold” with hands, “trip” with the stick or in any manner) to impede an opponent who is not in “possession” of the puck. Illegal means are acts which allow a Player to “establish,  maintain or restore body position” other than by skating. Pick: A “pick” is the action of a Player who checks an opponent who is not in “possession” of the puck and is unaware of the impending check/hit. A Player who is aware of an impending hit, not deemed to be a legal “battle for the puck,” may not be interfered with by a Player delivering a “pick.” A Player delivering a “pick” is one who moves into an opponent’s path without initially having “body position”, thereby taking them “out of the play”. When this is done, an “interference” penalty shall be assessed. Free Hand: When a “free hand” is used to hold, pull, tug, grab or physically restrain an opponent from moving “freely”, this must be penalized as “holding”. The “free hand” may be used by a Player to “fend off” an opponent or their stick but may not be used to hold an opponent’s stick or body. Stick: A Player who does not have “body position” on their opponent, who uses their stick (either the blade or the shaft, including the butt-end of the shaft) to impede or prevent their opponent from moving “freely” on the ice shall be assessed a “hooking” penalty. (Rule 55 – Hooking) A Minor Penalty for “interference” shall be assessed: (I) On a Player who interferes with or impedes the progress of an opponent who is not in “possession” of the puck; (II) On a Player who restrains an opponent who is attempting to “fore-check”; (III) On any Player who deliberately checks an opponent, including the Goalkeeper, who is “not or no longer deemed in possession” of the puck (“late-hit”); (IV) On a Player who shall cause an opponent who is not in “possession” of the puck to be forced off-side, causing a stoppage in play. If this action causes a delayed off-side (and not necessarily a stoppage in play), then the application of a penalty for “interference” is subject to the judgment of the Referee; (V) On a Player who deliberately “knocks” the stick out of an opponent’s hand or prevents a Player who has dropped their stick or any other piece of equipment from regaining “possession” of it, (VI) On a Player who “knocks or shoots” any abandoned or broken stick or illegal puck or other debris towards an opposing puck carrier in a manner that could cause them to be distracted; (Rule 53 – Throwing Equipment.;) (VII) On any identifiable Player on the Players’ Bench or Penalty Box who, by means of their stick or their body, interferes with the movements of the puck or any opponent on the ice during the progress of the play; (VIII) On any Player about to come onto the ice who plays the puck while one or both skates are still on the Players’ or Penalty Box. The appropriate penalty according to the playing rules shall be assessed when a Player on the Players’ or Penalty Box gets involved with an opponent on the ice during a stoppage in play. The Player(s) involved may be subject to additional sanctions as appropriate. (Rule 28 – Supplementary Discipline) A Bench Minor Penalty shall be assessed when an unidentifiable Player on the Players’ Bench or Penalty Box or any Coach or team personnel who, by means of their stick or their body, interferes with the movements of the puck or any opponent on the ice during the progress of the play. The Referee, at their discretion, may assess a Major Penalty to a Player guilty of “interference” on an opponent, and who recklessly endangers the fouled Player in a way that at the discretion of the Referee such Player would not be sufficiently sanctioned by imposing a Minor Penalty. The Referee, at their discretion, may assess a Major Penalty and a Game Misconduct Penalty if, in their judgment, the Player recklessly endangers their opponent by an “interference or a late-hit” and the player would not be sufficiently sanctioned by imposing a Major Penalty. Such assessment of reckless endangerment shall be based on the severity of the infraction, severity of the contact, the degree of violence and the general reprehensibility involved. When a Player in control of the puck in the Neutral or Attacking Zone and having no other opponent to pass than the Goalkeeper is interfered with by a stick or any part thereof or any other object or piece of equipment thrown or shot by any member of the defending Team including the Coach or team personnel, a “Penalty Shot” shall be awarded to the non-offending Team. When a Coach or non-playing Team Personnel is guilty of such an act, they shall receive a Game misconduct penalty and be ordered to the Dressing Room. The incident will be reported to the Proper Authorities for possible further disciplinary action. If, when the Goalkeeper has been removed from the ice, any member of their Team (including the Goalkeeper) not legally on the ice, including the Coach or team personnel, interferes by means of their body, stick or any other object or piece of equipment with the movements of the puck or an opposing Player in the neutral or Attacking Zone, the Referee shall immediately Award a Goal to the non-offending Team. When a Coach or team personnel is guilty of such an act, they shall be assessed with a game Misconduct penalty, ordered to the Dressing Room and the incident will be reported to the Proper Authorities for possible further disciplinary action. If deemed appropriate, Supplementary Discipline can be applied by the Proper Authorities at their discretion. (Rule 28 – Supplementary Discipline) Any occurrence of spectator interference must be reported by the On-ice Officials to the Proper Authorities. (I) In the event objects are thrown onto the ice by spectators and game action is compromised, On-ice Officials will stop play and the ensuing “face-off” will take place at the nearest Face-off Spot to where play was stopped. (II) In the event of a Player being held or interfered with by a spectator, play will be stopped. If the Team of the Player interfered with is in “possession of the puck”, game action will continue until a “change of possession” occurs.Apparent goals shall be disallowed by the Referee and the appropriate announcement made by the Public Address Announcer for the following reasons: (I) When the puck has been directed with any part of their body (excl. skates), batted or thrown into the net by an attacking Player other than with a stick. When this occurs, if it is deemed to be done deliberately, then the decision shall be NO GOAL. A goal cannot be scored when the puck has been deliberately batted with any part of the attacking Player’s body into the net (Rule 78.4 – Scoring a Goal) (II) When the puck has been kicked using a distinct kicking motion (Rule 49.2 – Kicking) (III) When the puck has deflected directly into the net off an official (Rule 85.4 – Puck Striking Official) (IV) When a goal has been scored and an ineligible Player is on the ice (Rule 68.5 – Disallowed Goal) (V) When an attacking Player has interfered with a Goalkeeper in their Goal Crease (Rule 69.1 – Interference on the Goalkeeper) (VI) When the puck has entered the net after making contact with an attacking Player’s stick that is above the height of the crossbar. Where the puck makes contact with the stick is the determining factor (Rule 80.3 – Disallowed Goal) (VII) When Video Review confirms the scoring of a goal at one end of the ice, any goal scored at the other end on the same play must be disallowed (Rule 37.2 – Video Review) (VIII) When a Linesperson reports a Double-minor Penalty for high-sticking or a Major Penalty to the Referee following the scoring of a goal by the offending Team, the goal must be disallowed, and the appropriate penalty assessed (Rule 32.4 – Reporting to Referee) (IX) When a Goalkeeper has been pushed into the net together with the puck after making a save (Rule 69.7 – Rebounds and Loose Pucks) (X) When the net becomes displaced accidentally. The goal frame is considered to be displaced if either or both goal pegs are no longer in their respective holes in the ice, or the net has come completely off one or both pegs, prior to or as the puck enters the goal. However, if this occurs as a result of the actions of a defending player, refer to (Rule 63.7 – Awarded Goal) (XI) During the delayed calling of a penalty, the offending Team cannot score unless the non-offending Team shoots the puck into their own net. This shall mean that a deflection off an offending Player or any physical action by an offending Player that may cause the puck to enter the non-offending Team’s goal, shall not be considered a legal goal. Play shall be stopped before the puck enters the net (whenever possible) and the signaled penalty assessed to the offending Team; (XII) When the Referee deems the play has been stopped, even if they have not physically had the opportunity to stop play by blowing their whistle; (XIII) Any goal scored, other than as covered by the official rules, shall not be allowed. This rule is based on the premise that an attacking Player’s position, whether inside or outside the Goal Crease, should not, by itself, determine whether a goal should be allowed or disallowed. In other words, goals scored while attacking Players are standing in the Goal Crease may, in appropriate circumstances be allowed. Goals should be disallowed only if: (I) an attacking Player, either by their positioning or by a \"relevant contact”, impairs the Goalkeeper’s ability to move freely within their Goal Crease or defend their goal; or (II) an attacking Player initiates intentional or deliberate contact with a Goalkeeper, inside or outside of their Goal Crease. “Incidental contact” with a Goalkeeper will be permitted, and resulting goals allowed, when such contact is initiated outside of the Goal Crease, provided the attacking Player has made a reasonable effort to avoid such contact. The rule will be enforced exclusively in accordance with the on-ice judgement of the Referee(s), but may be subject to a Video Review: (Rule 37 – Video Review) when applicable or to a Coach’s Challenge (Rule 38 – Coach’s Challenge) For purposes of this rule, “contact / relevant contact” whether \"incidental or otherwise\", shall mean any contact that is made between or among a Goalkeeper and attacking Player(s), whether by means of a stick or any part of the body. The overriding rationale of this rule is that a Goalkeeper should have the ability to move freely within their Goal Crease without being hindered by the actions of an attacking Player. If an attacking Player enters the Goal Crease and, by their actions, impairs the Goalkeeper’s ability to defend their goal, and a goal is scored, the goal will be disallowed. If an attacking Player is in the Goal Crease and does not leave immediately, the Referee has the possibility to stop the game and the subsequent “face-off” shall take place at the nearest Neutral Zone Face-off Spot outside the Attacking Zone of the offending Team. If an attacking Player has been pushed, shoved, or fouled by a defending Player so as to cause them to come into contact with the Goalkeeper, such contact will not be deemed contact initiated by the attacking Player for purposes of this rule, provided the attacking Player has made a reasonable effort to avoid such contact. If a defending Player has been pushed, shoved, or fouled by an attacking Player so as to cause the defending Player to come into contact with their own Goalkeeper, such contact shall be deemed contact initiated by the attacking Player for purposes of this rule, and if necessary, a penalty assessed to the attacking Player and if a goal is scored it would be disallowed. In all cases in which an attacking Player initiates “intentional or deliberate” contact with a Goalkeeper, whether or not the Goalkeeper is inside or outside the Goal Crease, and whether or not a goal is scored, the attacking Player will receive a penalty (Minor or Major, as the Referee deems appropriate). In all cases where the infraction being imposed is to the attacking Player for hindering the Goalkeeper’s ability to move freely in their Goal Crease, the penalty to be assessed is for “Goalkeeper interference”. In exercising their judgment, the Referee should give more significant consideration to the degree and nature of the relevant contact with the Goalkeeper than to the exact location of the Goalkeeper at the time of the contact. If an attacking Player initiates \"a relevant contact\" with a Goalkeeper, incidental or otherwise, while the Goalkeeper is in their Goal Crease, and a goal is scored, the goal will be disallowed. If a Goalkeeper, in the “act of establishing their position” within their Goal Crease, initiates contact with an attacking Player who is in the Goal Crease, and this results in an impairment of the Goalkeeper’s ability to defend their goal, and a goal is scored, the goal will be disallowed. If, after any contact by a Goalkeeper who is attempting to establish position in their Goal Crease, the attacking Player does not immediately vacate their current position in the Goal Crease (i.e., give ground to the Goalkeeper), and a goal is scored, the goal will be disallowed. In all such cases, whether or not a goal is scored, the attacking Player will receive the appropriate penalty for Goalkeeper “interference”. If an attacking Player establishes a “significant position” within the Goal Crease, so as to obstruct the Goalkeeper’s vision and impair their ability to defend their goal, and a goal is scored, the goal will be disallowed. For this purpose, a Player “establishes a significant position within the crease” when, in the Referee’s judgment, their body, or a substantial portion thereof, is within the Goal Crease for more than an instantaneous period of time. If an attacking Player initiates any \"relevant contact\" with a Goalkeeper, other than “incidental contact”, while the Goalkeeper is outside their Goal Crease, and a goal is scored, the goal will be disallowed. A Goalkeeper is not “fair game” just because they are outside the Goal Crease. The appropriate penalty should be assessed in every case where an attacking Player makes “unnecessary contact” with the Goalkeeper. However, “incidental contact” will be permitted when the Goalkeeper is in the act of playing the puck outside their Goal Crease provided the attacking Player has made a “reasonable effort” to avoid such unnecessary contact. When a Goalkeeper has played the puck outside of their Goal Crease and is then prevented from returning to their Goal Crease area due to the deliberate actions of an attacking Player, such Player may be penalized for “Goalkeeper interference”. Similarly, the Goalkeeper may be penalized, if by their actions outside of their Goal Crease they deliberately interfere with an attacking Player who is attempting to play the puck or an opponent.  (Rule 38 – Coach’s Challenge) Whenever the Referee stops play to disallow a goal as a result of “relevant contact” with the Goalkeeper (incidental or otherwise), the resulting “face-off” shall take place at the nearest Neutral Zone Face-off Spot outside the Attacking Zone of the offending Team. In a rebound situation, or where a Goalkeeper and attacking Player(s) are simultaneously attempting to play a loose puck, whether inside or outside the Goal Crease, “incidental contact” with the Goalkeeper will be permitted, and any goal that is scored as a result thereof will be allowed. In the event a Goalkeeper has been pushed into the net together with the puck by an attacking Player after making a stop, the goal will be disallowed. If applicable, appropriate penalties will be assessed. If, however, in the opinion of the Referee, the attacking Player was pushed or otherwise fouled by a defending Player causing the Goalkeeper to be pushed into the net together with the puck, the goal can be permitted. In the event the puck is under a Player in or around the Goal Crease area (deliberately or otherwise), a goal cannot be scored by pushing this Player together with the puck into the goal. If applicable, the appropriate penalties will be assessed, including a “Penalty Shot” if deemed to be covered in the Goal Crease deliberately. (Rule 63 – Delaying the Game) If deemed appropriate, Supplementary Discipline can be applied by the Proper Authorities at their discretion. (Rule 28 – Supplementary Discipline)",

The helmet should be attached in such a way that it cannot fall off. If it falls off and has not been removed by an opponent Player, it has not been attached correctly. A Player on the ice whose helmet comes off during play has to exit the playing surface immediately. A player on the ice whose helmet comes off during play is not allowed to retrieve and put their helmet back on their head – for this they have to proceed to their Players’ Bench and exit the playing surface. If a Player does not comply with this rule, they shall be assessed a Minor Penalty without a warning (Rule 12 – Illegal Equipment) If the Player returns to their Players’ Bench to be substituted for, they may only return to the ice during play with a helmet (with the chin strap properly fastened). No Player may exit the Penalty Box during play without a helmet (with the chin strap properly fastened). Should they do so, the play shall be stopped once their Team has gained control of the puck and a Minor Penalty shall be assessed to the offending Player. If a Player’s chin strap becomes unfastened during game action, but the helmet stays on their head, they may continue to play until the next stoppage or until they leave the ice. A Player who intentionally removes an opponent’s helmet during play shall be assessed a Minor Penalty for “Roughing”. (Rule 51 – Roughing) When a goalkeeper is hit on the face mask by a hard shot with the puck and the Referee believes the Goalkeeper is or may be dazed by that hard shot, the Referee may stop play for safety reasons, if there is no immediate scoring chance for the attacking Team. When a Goalkeeper has lost their helmet and/or face mask and their Team has control of the puck, play shall be stopped immediately to allow the Goalkeeper the opportunity to recollect their helmet and/or face mask. When the opposing Team has control of the puck, play shall only be stopped if there is no immediate and impending scoring opportunity. This stoppage of play must be made by the Referee. When play is stopped because the Goalkeeper has lost their helmet and/ or face mask, the ensuing “face-off” shall take place at one of the defending Team’s End Zone Face-off Spots. When a Goalkeeper deliberately removes their helmet and/or face mask to secure a stoppage of play, the Referee shall stop play as outlined above and assess the Goalkeeper a Minor Penalty for “Delay of Game”. (Rule 63 – Delaying the Game) If the Goalkeeper deliberately removes their helmet and/or face mask when the opposing Team is on a breakaway (where the criteria’s for a penalty shot is meet except for a foul from behind), or during the course of a “Penalty Shot” or shootout attempt, the Referee shall award a goal to the non-offending Team.If a penalized Player returns to the ice from the Penalty Box before their penalty has expired by their own error or the error of the Penalty Timekeeper, any goal scored by their own Team while they are illegally on the ice shall be disallowed but all penalties imposed on either Team shall be served as regular penalties. If a Player shall illegally enter the game from their own Players’ Bench or from the Penalty Box, any goal scored by their own Team while they are illegally on the ice shall be disallowed but all penalties imposed on either Team shall be served as regular penalties.",

At the discretion of the On-ice Officials, should a substituting Player come onto the ice before their Teammate is within the 1.50 m limit of the Players’ Bench (and therefore clearly causing their Team to have “too many Players” on the ice), then a Bench Minor Penalty may be assessed. When a Player is retiring from the ice surface and is within the 1.50 m limit of their Players’ Bench, and their substitute is on the ice, then the retiring Player shall be considered off the ice for the purpose of Rule 70 – Leaving Players Bench or Penalty Box. If in the course of making a substitution, either the Player entering the game or the Player retiring from the ice surface plays the puck with their stick, skates or hands or who checks or makes any physical contact with an opposing Player while either the Player entering the game or the retiring Player is actually on the ice, then the infraction of “too many Players on the ice” will be called. If in the course of a substitution either the Player(s) entering the play or the Player(s) retiring is struck by the puck accidentally, the play will not be stopped, and no penalty will be called. During the play, the Player retiring from the ice must do so at the Players’ Bench and not through any other exit leading from the Rink. This is not a legal Player change and therefore when a violation occurs, a Bench Minor Penalty shall be imposed. A Player coming onto the ice as a substitute Player is considered on the ice once both of their skates are on the ice. If they play the puck or interfere with an opponent while still on the Players’ Bench, they shall be penalized under (Rule 56 – Interference) A retiring Player (coming off the ice) who has one skate on the ice and one skate off the ice in the Players’ Bench is considered as “off the ice”. A Bench Minor Penalty for “too many Players on the ice” shall be assessed for a violation of this rule. This penalty can be assessed by the Referees or the Linespersons. Should a goal be scored by the offending Team prior to the Referee or Linesperson blowing their whistle to assess the Bench Minor Penalty, the goal shall be disallowed, and the penalty assessed for “too many Players on the ice”. A Player serving a penalty in the Penalty Box, who is to be changed after the penalty has been served, must proceed at once by way of the ice and be within 1.50 m of their own Players’ Bench before any change can be made. For any violation of this rule, a Bench Minor Penalty shall be imposed for “too many Players on the ice”. If by reason of insufficient playing time remaining, or by reason of penalties already imposed, a Bench Minor Penalty is imposed for “deliberate illegal substitution” (“too many Players on the ice”) which cannot be served in its entirety within the legal playing time, or at any time in Overtime, a “Penalty Shot” shall be awarded against the offending Team. Once the Goalkeeper has been removed for an extra Attacker in Overtime during the game, they must wait for the next stoppage of play before returning to their position. Any attempt by the Goalkeeper to return to his position prior to the next stoppage of play (“on the fly”) shall be deemed to be an “illegal substitution” and a Bench Minor penalty shall be assessed for having an ineligible Player would apply.",

No warm-up shall be permitted for a substitute Goalkeeper in any game. The substitute Goalkeeper shall be subject to the regular rules governing Goalkeepers and shall be entitled to the same privileges. When a substitution for the injured Goalkeeper has been made, the injured Goalkeeper is not allowed to resume the position until the next stoppage of play. For a violation of the rule, a Minor Penalty for “Delay of Game” shall be assessed. When play has been stopped by the Referee or Linesperson due to an injured Goalkeeper, such Goalkeeper must be substituted for only if they have to proceed to the Players’ Bench to receive medical attention. Where an injury has occurred to a Goalkeeper and there is a stoppage of play, a Team Doctor (or other Medical Personnel) may go onto the ice to attend to the injured Player without waiting for the Referee’s consent. If the Doctor or Medical Personnel has come onto the ice to attend to the Goalkeeper and there is no undue delay, the Goalkeeper may remain in the game. However, no additional time shall be permitted by the Referee for the purpose of enabling the injured Goalkeeper to resume their position (i.e., no warm-up).The Referee shall announce the reason for the assessed “Penalty Shot” and shall have the Skater selected by the Team entitled to take the “Penalty Shot” announced over the Public Address System. The puck shall then be placed on the Center Face-off Spot and the Player taking the “Penalty Shot” will, on the instruction of the Referee, by blowing their whistle, play the puck from there and shall attempt to score on the Goalkeeper. The puck must be kept in motion towards the opponent’s Goal Line and once it is shot, the play shall be considered complete. No goal can be scored on a rebound of any kind (an exception being the puck off the Goal Post or crossbar, then the Goalkeeper and then directly into the goal), and any time the puck crosses the Goal Line or comes to a complete stop, the “Penalty Shot” shall be considered complete. The “lacrosse-like move” whereby the puck is picked up on the blade of the stick and “whipped” into the net shall be permitted provided the puck is not raised above the height of the shoulders at any time and when released, is not carried higher than the crossbar. (Rule 80.1 – High-sticking the Puck) The “spin-o-rama type move” where the Player completes a 360° turn as they approach the goal, shall not be permitted. Should a Player perform such a move during the “Penalty Shot”, the shot shall be stopped by the Referee and no goal will be the result. Only a Player designated as a Goalkeeper or alternate Goalkeeper may defend against a “Penalty Shot”. The Goalkeeper must remain in their crease until the Player taking a “Penalty Shot” has touched the puck. If at the time a “Penalty Shot” is awarded, the Goalkeeper of the penalized Team has been removed from the ice to substitute another Player, the Goalkeeper shall be permitted to return to the ice before the “Penalty Shot” is taken. The Team against whom the “Penalty Shot” has been assessed may replace their Goalkeeper to defend against the shot, however, the substitute goalkeeper is required to remain in the game until the next stoppage of play. While the “Penalty Shot” is being taken, Players of both sides shall withdraw to the sides of the Rink and in front of their own Player’s Bench.Once the Goalkeeper has been removed for an extra Attacker in Overtime during the game, they must wait for the next stoppage of play before returning to their position. Any attempt by the Goalkeeper to return to his position prior to the next stoppage of play (“on the fly”) shall be deemed to be an “illegal substitution” and a Bench Minor penalty shall be assessed for having an ineligible Player would apply.Following the stoppage of play, the visiting Team shall promptly place a line-up on the ice ready for play and no substitution shall be made from that time until play has been resumed. The Home Team may then make any desired substitution, except in cases following an “icing”, which does not result in the delay of the game. “Placing a line-up on the ice” shall mean that both Teams shall place the full complement of Players (and not exceed) to which they are entitled within the line change time frame. If there is any undue delay by either Team in changing Players, the Referee shall order the offending Team or Teams to take their positions immediately and not permit any further Player changes. When a substitution has been made under the above rule, no additional substitution may be made until play commences. Once the line change procedure has been completed, no additional Player substitutions shall be permitted until the “face-off” has been completed legally and play has resumed, except when a penalty or penalties are imposed that affect the “on-ice strength” of either or both Teams. This may include penalties imposed following the completion of the line change and prior to the “face-off”, or due to a penalty assessed for a “face-off” violation – refer to Rule 82.2 – Line Change – Procedure. A Team that is in violation of (Rule 63.8 – Delaying the Game) or (Rule 81 – Icing) shall not be permitted to make any Player substitutions prior to the ensuing “face-off”. However, a Team shall be permitted to make a Player substitution to replace a Goalkeeper who had been substituted for an extra attacker, to replace an injured Player, or when a penalty has been assessed which affects the “on-ice strength” of either Team. The determination of Players on ice will be made when the puck leaves the offending Player’s stick. Goalkeepers’ substitution during a game will be conducted within the same time frame as a regular line change. No extra time will be allotted to the Goalkeeper coming off the bench, except in the case where an injury to a Goalkeeper occurs.",

If two (2) rule violations are the reason for the stoppage of play (e.g.: “high-sticking the puck” and “intentional off-side”), the ensuing “face-off location” shall be determined as the spot that provides the least amount of “territorial advantage” to the offending Team. When the play is stopped for any reason not specifically attributable to either Team while the puck is in the Neutral Zone, the ensuing “face-off” shall be conducted at the nearest Face-off Spot outside the Blue Line whenever possible. When it is unclear as to which of the four (4) Face-off Spots is the nearest, the spot that gives the Home Team the greatest “territorial advantage” in the Neutral Zone will be selected for the ensuing “face-off”. When Players are penalized at a stoppage of play so as to result in penalties being placed on the penalty time clock to one Team, the ensuing “face-off” shall be conducted at one of the two (2) Face-off Spots in the offending Team’s Defending Zone. There are only three (3) exceptions to this application: (I) when a penalty is assessed after the scoring of a goal – “face-off” shall be conducted at Center ice; (II) when a penalty is assessed at the end (or start) of a period – “face-off” shall be conducted at Center ice; (III) or when the defending Team is penalized, and the attacking Players enter the Attacking Zone beyond the outer edge of the End Zone Face-off Circle – “face-off” shall be conducted in the Neutral Zone. The Team awarded the “Power-Play” will have the choice of which End Zone spot the “face-off” will take place at to start the “Power-Play”. When an infringement of a rule has been committed by Players of both Teams in the play resulting in the stoppage, the ensuing “face-off” will be conducted at the nearest Face-off Spot in that zone. When stoppage occurs between the end Face-off Spots and near end of the Rink, the puck shall be faced-off at the end Face-off Spot on the side where the stoppage occurs unless otherwise expressly provided by these rules. No “face-off” shall be made within 4.50 m of the goal or side Boards nor anywhere other than at a Face-off Spot. When a goal is illegally scored as a result of a puck being deflected directly off an Official, the resulting “face-off” shall be made at the nearest Face-off Spot in the zone where the puck deflected off of the Official. When a goal is illegally scored by the attacking Team by “directing”, “batting”, “kicking” or “high-sticking” the puck into the goal, the resulting “face-off” shall take place in the Neutral Zone at the nearest Face-off Spot. When the game is stopped for any reason not specifically covered in the official rules, the puck must be “faced-off” at a Face-off Spot in the zone nearest to where it was last played. Following a stoppage of play, should one or both defensemen who are the “point Players” or any Player coming from the Players’ Bench of the attacking Team, enter into the Attacking Zone beyond the outer edge of the End Zone Face-off Circle during an altercation, “gathering or scrum”, the ensuing “face-off” shall take place in the Neutral Zone near the Blue Line of the defending Team. This rule also applies when an “icing”, an “intentional off-side”, or a penalty has been assessed, and the ensuing “face-off” is to be in the offending Team’s Defending Zone. Should any of the non-offending Players enter the Attacking Zone beyond the outer edge of the End Zone Face-off Circle during an altercation, “gathering or scrum”, the ensuing “face-off” shall take place in the Neutral Zone near the Blue Line of the defending Team. For a violation of (Rule 71 – Premature Substitution) the resulting “face-off” will take place at the Center ice Face-off Spot when play is stopped beyond the Center red line. When play is stopped prior to the Center red line, the resulting “face-off” shall be conducted at the nearest Face-off Spot in the zone where the play was stopped. When play is stopped for an injured Player, the ensuing “face-off” shall be conducted at the Face-off Spot in the zone nearest the location of the puck when the play was stopped. When the injured Player’s Team has “control of the puck” in the Attacking Zone, the “face-off” shall be conducted at one of the Face-off Spots outside the Blue Line in the Neutral Zone. When the injured Player is in their Defending Zone and the attacking Team is in “control of the puck” in the Attacking Zone, the “face-off” shall be conducted at one of the defending Team’s end-zone Face-off Spots.",

Any Player except a Goalkeeper of the Team may be designated to serve the penalty by the Coach through the playing Captain and such Player shall take their place in the Penalty Box promptly and serve the penalty as if it was a Minor Penalty imposed upon them. Explanation “short-handed”: (Rule 16.2 – Short-handed) A list of the infractions that can result in a Bench Minor Penalty being assessed can be found in Table 3. Players may be changed at any time during the play from the Players’ Bench provided that the Player or Players leaving the ice shall be within 1.50 m of their Players’ Bench and out of the play before the change is made – refer also to Rule 71 – Premature Substitution. At the discretion of the On-ice Officials, should a substituting Player come onto the ice before their Teammate is within the 1.50 m limit of the Players’ Bench (and therefore clearly causing their Team to have “too many Players” on the ice), then a Bench Minor Penalty may be assessed. When a Player is retiring from the ice surface and is within the 1.50 m limit of their Players’ Bench, and their substitute is on the ice, then the retiring Player shall be considered off the ice for the purpose of Rule 70 – Leaving Players Bench or Penalty Box. If in the course of making a substitution, either the Player entering the game or the Player retiring from the ice surface plays the puck with their stick, skates or hands or who checks or makes any physical contact with an opposing Player while either the Player entering the game or the retiring Player is actually on the ice, then the infraction of “too many Players on the ice” will be called. If in the course of a substitution either the Player(s) entering the play or the Player(s) retiring is struck by the puck accidentally, the play will not be stopped, and no penalty will be called. During the play, the Player retiring from the ice must do so at the Players’ Bench and not through any other exit leading from the Rink. This is not a legal Player change and therefore when a violation occurs, a Bench Minor Penalty shall be imposed. A Player coming onto the ice as a substitute Player is considered on the ice once both of their skates are on the ice. If they play the puck or interfere with an opponent while still on the Players’ Bench, they shall be penalized under (Rule 56 – Interference) A retiring Player (coming off the ice) who has one skate on the ice and one skate off the ice in the Players’ Bench is considered as “off the ice”. A Bench Minor Penalty for “too many Players on the ice” shall be assessed for a violation of this rule. This penalty can be assessed by the Referees or the Linespersons. Should a goal be scored by the offending Team prior to the Referee or Linesperson blowing their whistle to assess the Bench Minor Penalty, the goal shall be disallowed, and the penalty assessed for “too many Players on the ice”. A Player serving a penalty in the Penalty Box, who is to be changed after the penalty has been served, must proceed at once by way of the ice and be within 1.50 m of their own Players’ Bench before any change can be made. For any violation of this rule, a Bench Minor Penalty shall be imposed for “too many Players on the ice”. If by reason of insufficient playing time remaining, or by reason of penalties already imposed, a Bench Minor Penalty is imposed for “deliberate illegal substitution” (“too many Players on the ice”) which cannot be served in its entirety within the legal playing time, or at any time in Overtime, a “Penalty Shot” shall be awarded against the offending Team. Once the Goalkeeper has been removed for an extra Attacker in Overtime during the game, they must wait for the next stoppage of play before returning to their position. Any attempt by the Goalkeeper to return to his position prior to the next stoppage of play (“on the fly”) shall be deemed to be an “illegal substitution” and a Bench Minor penalty shall be assessed for having an ineligible Player would apply.",

When a Player discards the broken portion of a stick or some other object by tossing it or shooting it to the side of the ice (and not over the Boards) in such a way as to not interfere with the play or opposing Player(s), no penalty will be imposed for so doing.

If two (2) rule violations are the reason for the stoppage of play (e.g.: “high-sticking the puck” and “intentional off-side”), the ensuing “face-off location” shall be determined as the spot that provides the least amount of “territorial advantage” to the offending Team. When the play is stopped for any reason not specifically attributable to either Team while the puck is in the Neutral Zone, the ensuing “face-off” shall be conducted at the nearest Face-off Spot outside the Blue Line whenever possible. When it is unclear as to which of the four (4) Face-off Spots is the nearest, the spot that gives the Home Team the greatest “territorial advantage” in the Neutral Zone will be selected for the ensuing “face-off”. When Players are penalized at a stoppage of play so as to result in penalties being placed on the penalty time clock to one Team, the ensuing “face-off” shall be conducted at one of the two (2) Face-off Spots in the offending Team’s Defending Zone. There are only three (3) exceptions to this application: (I) when a penalty is assessed after the scoring of a goal – “face-off” shall be conducted at Center ice; (II) when a penalty is assessed at the end (or start) of a period – “face-off” shall be conducted at Center ice; (III) or when the defending Team is penalized, and the attacking Players enter the Attacking Zone beyond the outer edge of the End Zone Face-off Circle – “face-off” shall be conducted in the Neutral Zone. The Team awarded the “Power-Play” will have the choice of which End Zone spot the “face-off” will take place at to start the “Power-Play”. When an infringement of a rule has been committed by Players of both Teams in the play resulting in the stoppage, the ensuing “face-off” will be conducted at the nearest Face-off Spot in that zone. When stoppage occurs between the end Face-off Spots and near end of the Rink, the puck shall be faced-off at the end Face-off Spot on the side where the stoppage occurs unless otherwise expressly provided by these rules. No “face-off” shall be made within 4.50 m of the goal or side Boards nor anywhere other than at a Face-off Spot. When a goal is illegally scored as a result of a puck being deflected directly off an Official, the resulting “face-off” shall be made at the nearest Face-off Spot in the zone where the puck deflected off of the Official. When a goal is illegally scored by the attacking Team by “directing”, “batting”, “kicking” or “high-sticking” the puck into the goal, the resulting “face-off” shall take place in the Neutral Zone at the nearest Face-off Spot. When the game is stopped for any reason not specifically covered in the official rules, the puck must be “faced-off” at a Face-off Spot in the zone nearest to where it was last played. Following a stoppage of play, should one or both defensemen who are the “point Players” or any Player coming from the Players’ Bench of the attacking Team, enter into the Attacking Zone beyond the outer edge of the End Zone Face-off Circle during an altercation, “gathering or scrum”, the ensuing “face-off” shall take place in the Neutral Zone near the Blue Line of the defending Team. This rule also applies when an “icing”, an “intentional off-side”, or a penalty has been assessed, and the ensuing “face-off” is to be in the offending Team’s Defending Zone. Should any of the non-offending Players enter the Attacking Zone beyond the outer edge of the End Zone Face-off Circle during an altercation, “gathering or scrum”, the ensuing “face-off” shall take place in the Neutral Zone near the Blue Line of the defending Team. For a violation of (Rule 71 – Premature Substitution) the resulting “face-off” will take place at the Center ice Face-off Spot when play is stopped beyond the Center red line. When play is stopped prior to the Center red line, the resulting “face-off” shall be conducted at the nearest Face-off Spot in the zone where the play was stopped. When play is stopped for an injured Player, the ensuing “face-off” shall be conducted at the Face-off Spot in the zone nearest the location of the puck when the play was stopped. When the injured Player’s Team has “control of the puck” in the Attacking Zone, the “face-off” shall be conducted at one of the Face-off Spots outside the Blue Line in the Neutral Zone. When the injured Player is in their Defending Zone and the attacking Team is in “control of the puck” in the Attacking Zone, the “face-off” shall be conducted at one of the defending Team’s end-zone Face-off Spots.When a puck goes outside the playing area at either end or either side of the Rink, strikes any obstacles above the playing surface other than the Boards or Protective Glass, causes the glass, lighting, timing device or the supports to break, it shall be “faced-off” at the nearest Face-off Spot in the zone from where it was shot or deflected out of play. Should the On-ice Officials rule that the shot or deflection that caused the puck to go out of play originated from the neutral or Defending Zones, the resulting “face-off” location shall be the nearest Face-off Spot closest to the origin of the shot or deflection that gives the offending Team the least amount of “territorial advantage”. If the puck comes to rest on top of the Boards surrounding the playing area, it shall be considered to be in play and may be played legally by hand or stick. When the puck goes outside the playing area directly off the “face-off”, regardless as to which Player may have last contacted the puck, the “face-off” shall remain in the same spot and no penalty will be assessed to either Team for delaying the game. When the puck is shot and it makes contact with the gloves or the body of a Player hanging over the Players’ Bench, or if the puck enters the Players’ Bench through an open bench door, the “face-off” shall take place at the nearest Face-off Spot in the zone from where the puck was shot, however, if the puck hits an opposing Player’s glove or body that is hanging over the opposing Team’s Players’ Bench or enters the opposing Team’s Players’ Bench through an open bench door, the “face-off” shall take place in the Neutral Zone adjacent to the opponent’s Players’ Bench. Should the puck strike the curved glass located at the end of either Players’ Bench, play shall be stopped when observed by any of the On-ice Officials. The ensuing “face-off” shall be determined as if the puck went outside the playing area. Should the puck strike the spectator netting at the ends and the corners of the arena, play shall be stopped, and the ensuing “faceoff” shall be determined as if the puck went outside the playing area. Players must not stop playing the game until they hear the whistle to do so.",

Should the On-ice Officials rule that the shot or deflection that caused the puck to go out of play originated from the neutral or Defending Zones, the resulting “face-off” location shall be the nearest Face-off Spot closest to the origin of the shot or deflection that gives the offending Team the least amount of “territorial advantage”. If the puck comes to rest on top of the Boards surrounding the playing area, it shall be considered to be in play and may be played legally by hand or stick. When the puck goes outside the playing area directly off the “face-off”, regardless as to which Player may have last contacted the puck, the “face-off” shall remain in the same spot and no penalty will be assessed to either Team for delaying the game. When the puck is shot and it makes contact with the gloves or the body of a Player hanging over the Players’ Bench, or if the puck enters the Players’ Bench through an open bench door, the “face-off” shall take place at the nearest Face-off Spot in the zone from where the puck was shot, however, if the puck hits an opposing Player’s glove or body that is hanging over the opposing Team’s Players’ Bench or enters the opposing Team’s Players’ Bench through an open bench door, the “face-off” shall take place in the Neutral Zone adjacent to the opponent’s Players’ Bench. Should the puck strike the curved glass located at the end of either Players’ Bench, play shall be stopped when observed by any of the On-ice Officials. The ensuing “face-off” shall be determined as if the puck went outside the playing area. Should the puck strike the spectator netting at the ends and the corners of the arena, play shall be stopped, and the ensuing “faceoff” shall be determined as if the puck went outside the playing area. Players must not stop playing the game until they hear the whistle to do so.A Minor Penalty for “Delay of Game” shall be assessed: (I) On any Player, including the Goalkeeper, who holds, “freezes” or plays the puck with their stick, skates or body in such a manner as to deliberately cause a stoppage of play. Regarding to a Goalkeeper, this rule applies outside of their Goal Crease area; (II) On any Player who deliberately shoots or bats (using their hand or stick) the puck outside the playing area (from anywhere on the ice surface) during the play or after a stoppage of play; (III) On any Player who shoots or bats (using their hand or stick) the puck directly (non-deflected) out of the playing surface from their Defending Zone, except where there is no Protective Glass. The determining factor shall be the position of the puck when it was shot or batted by the offending Player. If contact with the puck occurs while the puck is inside the Defending Zone, and subsequently goes out of play, the Minor Penalty shall be assessed. When the puck is shot over the Protective Glass surrounding the Players’ Bench, the penalty will be assessed. Note: When the puck is shot into the Players’ Bench, the penalty will not apply. When the puck goes out of the playing area directly off a “face-off”, no penalty shall be assessed; (IV) On any Player who delays the game by deliberately displacing a Goal Post from its normal position. The Referee shall stop play immediately when the offending Team gains “control” of the puck. Note: If a Player deliberately displaces a Goal Post from its normal position when an opponent has an imminent scoring opportunity on an open net, a goal may be awarded by the Referee (Rule 63.7 – Awarded Goal) (V) On a Player other than the Goalkeeper who deliberately falls on or gathers the puck into their body; Note: Any Player who drops to their knees to block a shot should not be penalized if the puck is shot under them or becomes lodged in their clothing or equipment but any use of the hands to make the puck unplayable should be penalized promptly; (VI) On a Goalkeeper who “races out” of their Goal Crease in an attempt to beat the attacking Player to the puck and instead of playing the puck jumps on the puck causing a stoppage of play; Note: If a Goalkeeper comes out of their Goal Crease to “cut down the angle” on a shot and after making the save covers the puck, this shall be legal. (VII) On a Goalkeeper who, when they are in their own Goal Crease, deliberately falls on or gathers the puck into their body or who holds or places the puck against any part of the goal in such a manner as to cause a stoppage of play unless they are actually being checked by an opponent; (VIII) On a Goalkeeper who plays the puck outside of the Designated Area behind the net. The determining factor shall be the position of the puck. Note: The Minor Penalty will not be assessed when a Goalkeeper plays the puck while maintaining skate contact with the Goal Crease. (IX) For adjustments to clothing, equipment, skates, or sticks. Note: No penalty should be assessed when a water bottle is delivered to a Goalkeeper, however, this should be conducted during time-outs and if, in the opinion of the Referee, it is being done to intentionally delay the game, a Minor Penalty may be assessed. (X) No delay shall be permitted for the repair or adjustment of Goalkeeper’s equipment. If adjustments are required, the Goalkeeper shall leave the ice and their place shall be taken by the substitute Goalkeeper immediately. For an infraction of this rule by a Goalkeeper, a Minor Penalty shall be imposed.",

The Team awarded the “Power-Play” will have the choice of which End Zone spot the “face-off” will take place at to start the “Power-Play”. When an infringement of a rule has been committed by Players of both Teams in the play resulting in the stoppage, the ensuing “face-off” will be conducted at the nearest Face-off Spot in that zone. When stoppage occurs between the end Face-off Spots and near end of the Rink, the puck shall be faced-off at the end Face-off Spot on the side where the stoppage occurs unless otherwise expressly provided by these rules. No “face-off” shall be made within 4.50 m of the goal or side Boards nor anywhere other than at a Face-off Spot. When a goal is illegally scored as a result of a puck being deflected directly off an Official, the resulting “face-off” shall be made at the nearest Face-off Spot in the zone where the puck deflected off of the Official. When a goal is illegally scored by the attacking Team by “directing”, “batting”, “kicking” or “high-sticking” the puck into the goal, the resulting “face-off” shall take place in the Neutral Zone at the nearest Face-off Spot. When the game is stopped for any reason not specifically covered in the official rules, the puck must be “faced-off” at a Face-off Spot in the zone nearest to where it was last played. Following a stoppage of play, should one or both defensemen who are the “point Players” or any Player coming from the Players’ Bench of the attacking Team, enter into the Attacking Zone beyond the outer edge of the End Zone Face-off Circle during an altercation, “gathering or scrum”, the ensuing “face-off” shall take place in the Neutral Zone near the Blue Line of the defending Team. This rule also applies when an “icing”, an “intentional off-side”, or a penalty has been assessed, and the ensuing “face-off” is to be in the offending Team’s Defending Zone. Should any of the non-offending Players enter the Attacking Zone beyond the outer edge of the End Zone Face-off Circle during an altercation, “gathering or scrum”, the ensuing “face-off” shall take place in the Neutral Zone near the Blue Line of the defending Team. For a violation of (Rule 71 – Premature Substitution) the resulting “face-off” will take place at the Center ice Face-off Spot when play is stopped beyond the Center red line. When play is stopped prior to the Center red line, the resulting “face-off” shall be conducted at the nearest Face-off Spot in the zone where the play was stopped. When play is stopped for an injured Player, the ensuing “face-off” shall be conducted at the Face-off Spot in the zone nearest the location of the puck when the play was stopped. When the injured Player’s Team has “control of the puck” in the Attacking Zone, the “face-off” shall be conducted at one of the Face-off Spots outside the Blue Line in the Neutral Zone. When the injured Player is in their Defending Zone and the attacking Team is in “control of the puck” in the Attacking Zone, the “face-off” shall be conducted at one of the defending Team’s end-zone Face-off Spots.",

If the attacking Team is at fault and the play is stopped while the puck is in the Attacking Zone, the ensuing “face-off” must be moved to the nearest Face-off Spot in the Neutral Zone.All “face-off” must be conducted on one of the nine (9) Face-off Spots located on the Rink. If two (2) rule violations are the reason for the stoppage of play (e.g.: “high-sticking the puck” and “intentional off-side”), the ensuing “face-off location” shall be determined as the spot that provides the least amount of “territorial advantage” to the offending Team. When the play is stopped for any reason not specifically attributable to either Team while the puck is in the Neutral Zone, the ensuing “face-off” shall be conducted at the nearest Face-off Spot outside the Blue Line whenever possible. When it is unclear as to which of the four (4) Face-off Spots is the nearest, the spot that gives the Home Team the greatest “territorial advantage” in the Neutral Zone will be selected for the ensuing “face-off”. When Players are penalized at a stoppage of play so as to result in penalties being placed on the penalty time clock to one Team, the ensuing “face-off” shall be conducted at one of the two (2) Face-off Spots in the offending Team’s Defending Zone. There are only three (3) exceptions to this application: (I) when a penalty is assessed after the scoring of a goal – “face-off” shall be conducted at Center ice; (II) when a penalty is assessed at the end (or start) of a period – “face-off” shall be conducted at Center ice; (III) or when the defending Team is penalized, and the attacking Players enter the Attacking Zone beyond the outer edge of the End Zone Face-off Circle – “face-off” shall be conducted in the Neutral Zone. The Team awarded the “Power-Play” will have the choice of which End Zone spot the “face-off” will take place at to start the “Power-Play”. When an infringement of a rule has been committed by Players of both Teams in the play resulting in the stoppage, the ensuing “face-off” will be conducted at the nearest Face-off Spot in that zone. When stoppage occurs between the end Face-off Spots and near end of the Rink, the puck shall be faced-off at the end Face-off Spot on the side where the stoppage occurs unless otherwise expressly provided by these rules. No “face-off” shall be made within 4.50 m of the goal or side Boards nor anywhere other than at a Face-off Spot. When a goal is illegally scored as a result of a puck being deflected directly off an Official, the resulting “face-off” shall be made at the nearest Face-off Spot in the zone where the puck deflected off of the Official. When a goal is illegally scored by the attacking Team by “directing”, “batting”, “kicking” or “high-sticking” the puck into the goal, the resulting “face-off” shall take place in the Neutral Zone at the nearest Face-off Spot. When the game is stopped for any reason not specifically covered in the official rules, the puck must be “faced-off” at a Face-off Spot in the zone nearest to where it was last played. Following a stoppage of play, should one or both defensemen who are the “point Players” or any Player coming from the Players’ Bench of the attacking Team, enter into the Attacking Zone beyond the outer edge of the End Zone Face-off Circle during an altercation, “gathering or scrum”, the ensuing “face-off” shall take place in the Neutral Zone near the Blue Line of the defending Team. This rule also applies when an “icing”, an “intentional off-side”, or a penalty has been assessed, and the ensuing “face-off” is to be in the offending Team’s Defending Zone. Should any of the non-offending Players enter the Attacking Zone beyond the outer edge of the End Zone Face-off Circle during an altercation, “gathering or scrum”, the ensuing “face-off” shall take place in the Neutral Zone near the Blue Line of the defending Team. For a violation of (Rule 71 – Premature Substitution) the resulting “face-off” will take place at the Center ice Face-off Spot when play is stopped beyond the Center red line. When play is stopped prior to the Center red line, the resulting “face-off” shall be conducted at the nearest Face-off Spot in the zone where the play was stopped. When play is stopped for an injured Player, the ensuing “face-off” shall be conducted at the Face-off Spot in the zone nearest the location of the puck when the play was stopped. When the injured Player’s Team has “control of the puck” in the Attacking Zone, the “face-off” shall be conducted at one of the Face-off Spots outside the Blue Line in the Neutral Zone. When the injured Player is in their Defending Zone and the attacking Team is in “control of the puck” in the Attacking Zone, the “face-off” shall be conducted at one of the defending Team’s end-zone Face-off Spots.",

A warning shall be issued to the offending Team and the “face-off” must be conducted again. When two (2) “face-off” violations” have been committed by the same Team during the same “face-off”, this Team shall be penalized with a Bench Minor Penalty to the offending Team. This penalty shall be announced as a “Bench Minor Penalty for “Delay of Game” – Face-off Violation.” “Face-off” violations shall be summarized as follows (any of the four (4) On-ice Officials may identify a “face-off” violation): (I) Encroachment by any Player other than the center into the “face-off” area prior to the puck being dropped. Players on the perimeter of the Face-off Circle must keep both skates outside the Face-off Circle – skate contact with the line is permitted. If a Player's skate crosses the line into the Face-off Circle prior to the drop of the puck, this shall be deemed as a “face-off” violation. A Player's stick may be inside the Face-off Circle provided there is no physical contact with their opponent or their opponent's stick. (II) Encroachment by any Player into the area between the hash marks on the outer edges of the Face-off Circle prior to the puck being dropped. Players must also ensure that both of their skates do not cross their respective hash marks. Contact with the line with their skate is permitted. If a Player's skate crosses the line into the area between the hash marks prior to the drop of the puck, this shall be deemed as a “face-off” violation. A Player's stick may be inside the area between the hash marks provided there is no physical contact with their opponent or their opponent's stick. (III) Any physical contact with an opponent prior to the puck being dropped. If either Player taking the “face-off” makes helmet-to-helmet contact with their opponent, they must receive a first “face-off” violation warning. If the Linesperson cannot differentiate which Player initiated the contact, both Players must receive a first “face-off” violation warning. (IV) Failure by either center taking the “face-off” to “properly position themself behind the restraining lines” or place their stick on the ice – as outlined in Rule 76.4 – Face-off Procedure – Centers. \"Properly position themself behind the restraining lines\" shall mean that the center must place their feet on either side of the restraining lines that are parallel to the side Boards (contact with the lines is permissible), and the toe of the blade of their skates must not cross over the restraining lines that are perpendicular to the side Boards as they approach the Face-off Spot. The blade of the stick must then be placed on the ice, at least the toe of the blade of the stick, in the designated white area of the Face-off Spot and must remain there until the puck is dropped. (V) Failure to comply with this positioning and “face-off” procedure will result in a “face-off” violation. Whenever a Team has committed two (2) “face-off” violations during the same “face-off”, the Referee shall immediately assess the offending Team a Bench Minor Penalty for “Delay of Game”. This penalty shall be announced as a Bench Minor Penalty for Delay of Game – Face-off Violation. Players who are late to the “face-off” location and therefore in an off-side position for the ensuing “face-off” will be warned once in the game by the Referee. This warning will also be given to the offending Team’s Coach. In this situation, the offending Team’s center will not receive a warning for a “face-off” violation. Any subsequent violation shall result in a Bench Minor Penalty for “Delay of Game” being assessed to the offending Team.

All Players, other than the centers, shall be uniformly back from the “face-off” location similar to being outside the Face-off Circle for “face-offs” in the End Zones.Following a stoppage of play, the Referee will enforce the following line change procedure once they have determined that this procedure may begin: (I) The Referee shall give the visiting Team up to five (5) seconds to make its line change. (II) The Referee shall raise their hand to indicate no further changes by the visiting Team and to commence the Home Team’s line change. (III) The Referee shall give the Home Team up to eight (8) seconds to make its line change. (IV) The Referee shall lower their hand to indicate no further changes by the Home Team. (V) Any attempt by the either Team to make a change after the Referee’s signal, attempt to place too many Players on the ice for the subsequent line change, or attempt to make additional personnel changes, shall not be permitted and the Referee will send the Players who have attempted to change back to their Players’ Bench. The Referee will then issue a warning to the offending Team (through the Coach) indicating that any subsequent violations during the rest of the game (including Overtime), shall result in a Bench Minor Penalty for “delaying the game”. This penalty shall be announced as a “Bench Minor Penalty for “Delay of Game” – Improper Line Change.” (VI) The Linesperson conducting the “face-off” will blow their whistle (once the Referee has lowered their hand for the line changes) to indicate that all Players must be in position and on-side for the “face-off” within five (5) seconds. The “faceoff” will then be conducted (Rule 76 – Face-offs) (VII) Players who are slow (after the five-second warning whistle given by the Linesperson) getting to the “face-off” location or who are in an off-side position for the ensuing “face-off” will be warned once in the game by the Referee. This warning will also be given to the offending Team’s Coach. In this situation, the offending Team’s center is not ejected from the “face-off”. Any subsequent violation shall result in a Bench Minor Penalty for “Delay of Game” being assessed to the offending Team. (VIII) In the last two (2) minutes of regulation time and any time in the Overtime period(s), points (vi) and (vii) above are not applicable.

(II) Encroachment by any Player into the area between the hash marks on the outer edges of the Face-off Circle prior to the puck being dropped. Players must also ensure that both of their skates do not cross their respective hash marks. Contact with the line with their skate is permitted. If a Player's skate crosses the line into the area between the hash marks prior to the drop of the puck, this shall be deemed as a “face-off” violation. A Player's stick may be inside the area between the hash marks provided there is no physical contact with their opponent or their opponent's stick. (III) Any physical contact with an opponent prior to the puck being dropped. If either Player taking the “face-off” makes helmet-to-helmet contact with their opponent, they must receive a first “face-off” violation warning. If the Linesperson cannot differentiate which Player initiated the contact, both Players must receive a first “face-off” violation warning. (IV) Failure by either center taking the “face-off” to “properly position themself behind the restraining lines” or place their stick on the ice – as outlined in Rule 76.4 – Face-off Procedure – Centers. \"Properly position themself behind the restraining lines\" shall mean that the center must place their feet on either side of the restraining lines that are parallel to the side Boards (contact with the lines is permissible), and the toe of the blade of their skates must not cross over the restraining lines that are perpendicular to the side Boards as they approach the Face-off Spot. The blade of the stick must then be placed on the ice, at least the toe of the blade of the stick, in the designated white area of the Face-off Spot and must remain there until the puck is dropped. (V) Failure to comply with this positioning and “face-off” procedure will result in a “face-off” violation. Whenever a Team has committed two (2) “face-off” violations during the same “face-off”, the Referee shall immediately assess the offending Team a Bench Minor Penalty for “Delay of Game”. This penalty shall be announced as a Bench Minor Penalty for Delay of Game – Face-off Violation. Players who are late to the “face-off” location and therefore in an off-side position for the ensuing “face-off” will be warned once in the game by the Referee. This warning will also be given to the offending Team’s Coach. In this situation, the offending Team’s center will not receive a warning for a “face-off” violation. Any subsequent violation shall result in a Bench Minor Penalty for “Delay of Game” being assessed to the offending Team. This penalty shall be announced as a “Bench Minor Penalty for “Delay of Game” – Slow Proceeding to Face-off Location. In the conduct of any “face-off” at any of the nine (9) Face-off Spots on the playing surface, no Player facing-off shall make any physical contact with their opponent’s body by means of their own body or by their stick except in the course of playing the puck after the “face-off” has been completed. For violation of this rule, the Referee may, at their discretion impose a Minor Penalty or penalties on the Player(s) whose action(s) caused the “physical contact”. Nonetheless, this “physical contact” prior to the dropping of the puck shall be deemed as a “face-off” violation and the center will be warned by the Linesperson that the Team has committed a “face-off” violation and any subsequent violation will result in a Bench Minor Penalty for “Delay of Game” – “face-off” violation being assessed. “Face-off” encroachment may be applied during “face-offs” at any of the nine (9) Face-off Spots on the playing surface However, since no such lines are painted on the ice at the four (4) Face-off Spots adjacent to the Blue Lines, Linespersons shall use their judgment as to whether or not a violation has occurred. All Players, other than the centers, shall be uniformly back from the “face-off” location similar to being outside the Face-off Circle for “face-offs” in the End Zones.Any loss of time on the game or penalty clocks due to a false “face-off” or a “face-off” violation must be replaced. The Video Review Consultant may be consulted to ensure the time is accurately replaced. (Rule 37.6 – Video Review to verify time on clock) The whistle will not be blown by the Official to start play. Playing time will commence from the instant the puck is “faced-off” and will stop when the whistle is blown, or a goal is scored.All “face-off” must be conducted on one of the nine (9) Face-off Spots located on the Rink. If two (2) rule violations are the reason for the stoppage of play (e.g.: “high-sticking the puck” and “intentional off-side”), the ensuing “face-off location” shall be determined as the spot that provides the least amount of “territorial advantage” to the offending Team. When the play is stopped for any reason not specifically attributable to either Team while the puck is in the Neutral Zone, the ensuing “face-off” shall be conducted at the nearest Face-off Spot outside the Blue Line whenever possible. When it is unclear as to which of the four (4) Face-off Spots is the nearest, the spot that gives the Home Team the greatest “territorial advantage” in the Neutral Zone will be selected for the ensuing “face-off”. When Players are penalized at a stoppage of play so as to result in penalties being placed on the penalty time clock to one Team, the ensuing “face-off” shall be conducted at one of the two (2) Face-off Spots in the offending Team’s Defending Zone. There are only three (3) exceptions to this application: (I) when a penalty is assessed after the scoring of a goal – “face-off” shall be conducted at Center ice; (II) when a penalty is assessed at the end (or start) of a period – “face-off” shall be conducted at Center ice; (III) or when the defending Team is penalized, and the attacking Players enter the Attacking Zone beyond the outer edge of the End Zone Face-off Circle – “face-off” shall be conducted in the Neutral Zone. The Team awarded the “Power-Play” will have the choice of which End Zone spot the “face-off” will take place at to start the “Power-Play”. When an infringement of a rule has been committed by Players of both Teams in the play resulting in the stoppage, the ensuing “face-off” will be conducted at the nearest Face-off Spot in that zone. When stoppage occurs between the end Face-off Spots and near end of the Rink, the puck shall be faced-off at the end Face-off Spot on the side where the stoppage occurs unless otherwise expressly provided by these rules. No “face-off” shall be made within 4.50 m of the goal or side Boards nor anywhere other than at a Face-off Spot. When a goal is illegally scored as a result of a puck being deflected directly off an Official, the resulting “face-off” shall be made at the nearest Face-off Spot in the zone where the puck deflected off of the Official. When a goal is illegally scored by the attacking Team by “directing”, “batting”, “kicking” or “high-sticking” the puck into the goal, the resulting “face-off” shall take place in the Neutral Zone at the nearest Face-off Spot. When the game is stopped for any reason not specifically covered in the official rules, the puck must be “faced-off” at a Face-off Spot in the zone nearest to where it was last played. Following a stoppage of play, should one or both defensemen who are the “point Players” or any Player coming from the Players’ Bench of the attacking Team, enter into the Attacking Zone beyond the outer edge of the End Zone Face-off Circle during an altercation, “gathering or scrum”, the ensuing “face-off” shall take place in the Neutral Zone near the Blue Line of the defending Team. This rule also applies when an “icing”, an “intentional off-side”, or a penalty has been assessed, and the ensuing “face-off” is to be in the offending Team’s Defending Zone. Should any of the non-offending Players enter the Attacking Zone beyond the outer edge of the End Zone Face-off Circle during an altercation, “gathering or scrum”, the ensuing “face-off” shall take place in the Neutral Zone near the Blue Line of the defending Team. For a violation of (Rule 71 – Premature Substitution) the resulting “face-off” will take place at the Center ice Face-off Spot when play is stopped beyond the Center red line. When play is stopped prior to the Center red line, the resulting “face-off” shall be conducted at the nearest Face-off Spot in the zone where the play was stopped. When play is stopped for an injured Player, the ensuing “face-off” shall be conducted at the Face-off Spot in the zone nearest the location of the puck when the play was stopped. When the injured Player’s Team has “control of the puck” in the Attacking Zone, the “face-off” shall be conducted at one of the Face-off Spots outside the Blue Line in the Neutral Zone. When the injured Player is in their Defending Zone and the attacking Team is in “control of the puck” in the Attacking Zone, the “face-off” shall be conducted at one of the defending Team’s end-zone Face-off Spots.Following the stoppage of play, the visiting Team shall promptly place a line-up on the ice ready for play and no substitution shall be made from that time until play has been resumed. The Home Team may then make any desired substitution, except in cases following an “icing”, which does not result in the delay of the game. “Placing a line-up on the ice” shall mean that both Teams shall place the full complement of Players (and not exceed) to which they are entitled within the line change time frame. If there is any undue delay by either Team in changing Players, the Referee shall order the offending Team or Teams to take their positions immediately and not permit any further Player changes. When a substitution has been made under the above rule, no additional substitution may be made until play commences. Once the line change procedure has been completed, no additional Player substitutions shall be permitted until the “face-off” has been completed legally and play has resumed, except when a penalty or penalties are imposed that affect the “on-ice strength” of either or both Teams. This may include penalties imposed following the completion of the line change and prior to the “face-off”, or due to a penalty assessed for a “face-off” violation – refer to Rule 82.2 – Line Change – Procedure. A Team that is in violation of (Rule 63.8 – Delaying the Game) or (Rule 81 – Icing) shall not be permitted to make any Player substitutions prior to the ensuing “face-off”. However, a Team shall be permitted to make a Player substitution to replace a Goalkeeper who had been substituted for an extra attacker, to replace an injured Player, or when a penalty has been assessed which affects the “on-ice strength” of either Team. The determination of Players on ice will be made when the puck leaves the offending Player’s stick. Goalkeepers’ substitution during a game will be conducted within the same time frame as a regular line change. No extra time will be allotted to the Goalkeeper coming off the bench, except in the case where an injury to a Goalkeeper occurs.",

If a Player's skate crosses the line into the Face-off Circle prior to the drop of the puck, this shall be deemed as a “face-off” violation. A Player's stick may be inside the Face-off Circle provided there is no physical contact with their opponent or their opponent's stick. (II) Encroachment by any Player into the area between the hash marks on the outer edges of the Face-off Circle prior to the puck being dropped. Players must also ensure that both of their skates do not cross their respective hash marks. Contact with the line with their skate is permitted. If a Player's skate crosses the line into the area between the hash marks prior to the drop of the puck, this shall be deemed as a “face-off” violation. A Player's stick may be inside the area between the hash marks provided there is no physical contact with their opponent or their opponent's stick. (III) Any physical contact with an opponent prior to the puck being dropped. If either Player taking the “face-off” makes helmet-to-helmet contact with their opponent, they must receive a first “face-off” violation warning. If the Linesperson cannot differentiate which Player initiated the contact, both Players must receive a first “face-off” violation warning. (IV) Failure by either center taking the “face-off” to “properly position themself behind the restraining lines” or place their stick on the ice – as outlined in Rule 76.4 – Face-off Procedure – Centers. \"Properly position themself behind the restraining lines\" shall mean that the center must place their feet on either side of the restraining lines that are parallel to the side Boards (contact with the lines is permissible), and the toe of the blade of their skates must not cross over the restraining lines that are perpendicular to the side Boards as they approach the Face-off Spot. The blade of the stick must then be placed on the ice, at least the toe of the blade of the stick, in the designated white area of the Face-off Spot and must remain there until the puck is dropped. (V) Failure to comply with this positioning and “face-off” procedure will result in a “face-off” violation. Whenever a Team has committed two (2) “face-off” violations during the same “face-off”, the Referee shall immediately assess the offending Team a Bench Minor Penalty for “Delay of Game”. This penalty shall be announced as a Bench Minor Penalty for Delay of Game – Face-off Violation. Players who are late to the “face-off” location and therefore in an off-side position for the ensuing “face-off” will be warned once in the game by the Referee. This warning will also be given to the offending Team’s Coach. In this situation, the offending Team’s center will not receive a warning for a “face-off” violation. Any subsequent violation shall result in a Bench Minor Penalty for “Delay of Game” being assessed to the offending Team. This penalty shall be announced as a “Bench Minor Penalty for “Delay of Game” – Slow Proceeding to Face-off Location. In the conduct of any “face-off” at any of the nine (9) Face-off Spots on the playing surface, no Player facing-off shall make any physical contact with their opponent’s body by means of their own body or by their stick except in the course of playing the puck after the “face-off” has been completed. For violation of this rule, the Referee may, at their discretion impose a Minor Penalty or penalties on the Player(s) whose action(s) caused the “physical contact”. Nonetheless, this “physical contact” prior to the dropping of the puck shall be deemed as a “face-off” violation and the center will be warned by the Linesperson that the Team has committed a “face-off” violation and any subsequent violation will result in a Bench Minor Penalty for “Delay of Game” – “face-off” violation being assessed. “Face-off” encroachment may be applied during “face-offs” at any of the nine (9) Face-off Spots on the playing surface However, since no such lines are painted on the ice at the four (4) Face-off Spots adjacent to the Blue Lines, Linespersons shall use their judgment as to whether or not a violation has occurred. All Players, other than the centers, shall be uniformly back from the “face-off” location similar to being outside the Face-off Circle for “face-offs” in the End Zones.",

At the eight (8) Face-off Spots (excluding Center ice Faceoff Spot), the defending Player shall place their stick within the designated white area first followed immediately by the attacking Player. When the “face-off” is conducted at the Center ice Face-off Spot, the visiting Player shall place their stick on the ice first. If a Player facing-off fails to take their proper position immediately when directed by the On-ice Official, the Official may assess a warning for a “face-off” violation. If a center is not at the designated “face-off” area once the five (5) second time limit has elapsed, the Linesperson will drop the puck immediately. If the center is back from the Face-off Spot, is “quarterbacking” or refuses to come into the “face-off” area when instructed to do so by the Linesperson, or the center is simply slow getting to the Face-off Spot when the five (5) seconds has elapsed, the puck shall be dropped. If the center attempts to arrive at the Face-off Spot just as the five seconds elapses in an attempt to gain an advantage to win the “face-off”, the center will be warned by the Linesperson that they have committed a “face-off” violation. If a Player received a warning for a “face-off” violation, they must come into position quickly or risk having the puck dropped by the Linesperson without the Player being set or will result in a Bench Minor Penalty for “Delay of Game” for a second “face-off” violation during the same “face-off”.If a center should move prematurely prior to the “face-off”, or if the Referee or Linesperson shall have dropped the puck unfairly, the “face-off” shall be considered a “face-off” violation. A warning shall be issued to the offending Team and the “face-off” must be conducted again. When two (2) “face-off” violations” have been committed by the same Team during the same “face-off”, this Team shall be penalized with a Bench Minor Penalty to the offending Team. This penalty shall be announced as a “Bench Minor Penalty for “Delay of Game” – Face-off Violation.” “Face-off” violations shall be summarized as follows (any of the four (4) On-ice Officials may identify a “face-off” violation): (I) Encroachment by any Player other than the center into the “face-off” area prior to the puck being dropped. Players on the perimeter of the Face-off Circle must keep both skates outside the Face-off Circle – skate contact with the line is permitted. If a Player's skate crosses the line into the Face-off Circle prior to the drop of the puck, this shall be deemed as a “face-off” violation. A Player's stick may be inside the Face-off Circle provided there is no physical contact with their opponent or their opponent's stick. (II) Encroachment by any Player into the area between the hash marks on the outer edges of the Face-off Circle prior to the puck being dropped. Players must also ensure that both of their skates do not cross their respective hash marks. Contact with the line with their skate is permitted. If a Player's skate crosses the line into the area between the hash marks prior to the drop of the puck, this shall be deemed as a “face-off” violation. A Player's stick may be inside the area between the hash marks provided there is no physical contact with their opponent or their opponent's stick. (III) Any physical contact with an opponent prior to the puck being dropped. If either Player taking the “face-off” makes helmet-to-helmet contact with their opponent, they must receive a first “face-off” violation warning. If the Linesperson cannot differentiate which Player initiated the contact, both Players must receive a first “face-off” violation warning. (IV) Failure by either center taking the “face-off” to “properly position themself behind the restraining lines” or place their stick on the ice – as outlined in Rule 76.4 – Face-off Procedure – Centers. \"Properly position themself behind the restraining lines\" shall mean that the center must place their feet on either side of the restraining lines that are parallel to the side Boards (contact with the lines is permissible), and the toe of the blade of their skates must not cross over the restraining lines that are perpendicular to the side Boards as they approach the Face-off Spot. The blade of the stick must then be placed on the ice, at least the toe of the blade of the stick, in the designated white area of the Face-off Spot and must remain there until the puck is dropped. (V) Failure to comply with this positioning and “face-off” procedure will result in a “face-off” violation. Whenever a Team has committed two (2) “face-off” violations during the same “face-off”, the Referee shall immediately assess the offending Team a Bench Minor Penalty for “Delay of Game”. This penalty shall be announced as a Bench Minor Penalty for Delay of Game – Face-off Violation. Players who are late to the “face-off” location and therefore in an off-side position for the ensuing “face-off” will be warned once in the game by the Referee. This warning will also be given to the offending Team’s Coach. In this situation, the offending Team’s center will not receive a warning for a “face-off” violation. Any subsequent violation shall result in a Bench Minor Penalty for “Delay of Game” being assessed to the offending Team. This penalty shall be announced as a “Bench Minor Penalty for “Delay of Game” – Slow Proceeding to Face-off Location. In the conduct of any “face-off” at any of the nine (9) Face-off Spots on the playing surface, no Player facing-off shall make any physical contact with their opponent’s body by means of their own body or by their stick except in the course of playing the puck after the “face-off” has been completed. For violation of this rule, the Referee may, at their discretion impose a Minor Penalty or penalties on the Player(s) whose action(s) caused the “physical contact”. Nonetheless, this “physical contact” prior to the dropping of the puck shall be deemed as a “face-off” violation and the center will be warned by the Linesperson that the Team has committed a “face-off” violation and any subsequent violation will result in a Bench Minor Penalty for “Delay of Game” – “face-off” violation being assessed. “Face-off” encroachment may be applied during “face-offs” at any of the nine (9) Face-off Spots on the playing surface However, since no such lines are painted on the ice at the four (4) Face-off Spots adjacent to the Blue Lines, Linespersons shall use their judgment as to whether or not a violation has occurred. All Players, other than the centers, shall be uniformly back from the “face-off” location similar to being outside the Face-off Circle for “face-offs” in the End Zones.",

When a goal is illegally scored as a result of a puck being deflected directly off an Official, the resulting “face-off” shall be made at the nearest Face-off Spot in the zone where the puck deflected off of the Official. When a goal is illegally scored by the attacking Team by “directing”, “batting”, “kicking” or “high-sticking” the puck into the goal, the resulting “face-off” shall take place in the Neutral Zone at the nearest Face-off Spot. When the game is stopped for any reason not specifically covered in the official rules, the puck must be “faced-off” at a Face-off Spot in the zone nearest to where it was last played. Following a stoppage of play, should one or both defensemen who are the “point Players” or any Player coming from the Players’ Bench of the attacking Team, enter into the Attacking Zone beyond the outer edge of the End Zone Face-off Circle during an altercation, “gathering or scrum”, the ensuing “face-off” shall take place in the Neutral Zone near the Blue Line of the defending Team. This rule also applies when an “icing”, an “intentional off-side”, or a penalty has been assessed, and the ensuing “face-off” is to be in the offending Team’s Defending Zone. Should any of the non-offending Players enter the Attacking Zone beyond the outer edge of the End Zone Face-off Circle during an altercation, “gathering or scrum”, the ensuing “face-off” shall take place in the Neutral Zone near the Blue Line of the defending Team. For a violation of (Rule 71 – Premature Substitution) the resulting “face-off” will take place at the Center ice Face-off Spot when play is stopped beyond the Center red line. When play is stopped prior to the Center red line, the resulting “face-off” shall be conducted at the nearest Face-off Spot in the zone where the play was stopped. When play is stopped for an injured Player, the ensuing “face-off” shall be conducted at the Face-off Spot in the zone nearest the location of the puck when the play was stopped. When the injured Player’s Team has “control of the puck” in the Attacking Zone, the “face-off” shall be conducted at one of the Face-off Spots outside the Blue Line in the Neutral Zone. When the injured Player is in their Defending Zone and the attacking Team is in “control of the puck” in the Attacking Zone, the “face-off” shall be conducted at one of the defending Team’s end-zone Face-off Spots.",

In order to award a goal in this situation, the Goal Post must have been displaced by the actions of a defending Player, the attacking Player must have “an imminent scoring opportunity” prior to the Goal Post being displaced, and it must be determined that the puck would have entered the Goal between the normal position of the Goal Posts.

The goal frame is considered to be displaced if either or both goal pegs are no longer in their respective holes in the ice, or the net has come completely off one or both pegs, prior to or as the puck enters the goal.",

During the play, if an injured Player wishes to retire from the ice and be replaced by a substitute, they must do so at the Players’ Bench and not through any other exit leading from the Rink. This is not a legal Player change and therefore when a violation occurs, a Bench-minor Penalty shall be imposed. If a penalized Player has been injured, they may proceed to the Dressing Room without taking a seat in the Penalty Box. The penalized Team shall immediately put a substitute Player in the Penalty Box, who shall serve the penalty until the injured Player is able to return to the game. They would replace their Teammate in the Penalty Box at the next stoppage of play. For violation of this rule, a Bench Minor Penalty shall be imposed. Should the injured penalized Player who has been replaced in the Penalty Box return to their Players’ Bench prior to the expiration of their penalty, they shall not be eligible to play until their penalty has expired.

When play is stopped for an injured Player, the ensuing “face-off” shall be conducted at the Face-off Spot in the zone nearest the location of the puck when the play was stopped. When the injured Player’s Team has control of the puck in the Attacking Zone, the “face-off” shall be conducted at the nearest Faceoff Spot in the Neutral Zone.

A Player serving a penalty in the Penalty Box, who is to be changed after the penalty has been served, must proceed at once by way of the ice and be at their own Players’ Bench before any change can be made.For any violation of this rule, a Bench Minor Penalty shall be imposed for “too many Players on the ice”. (Rule 74 – Too many Players on the Ice) A penalized Player who leaves the Penalty Box before their penalty has expired, whether play is in progress or not, shall incur an additional Minor Penalty after serving their unexpired penalty. Any Player who, having entered the Penalty Box, leaves the Penalty Box prior to the expiration of their penalty for the purpose of challenging an Official’s ruling, shall be assessed a Game Misconduct Penalty. If deemed appropriate, Supplementary Discipline can be applied by the Proper Authorities at their discretion. This rule does not replace any other more severe penalty that may be imposed for leaving the Penalty Box for the purpose of starting or participating in an altercation as outlined in this rule. (Rule 28 – Supplementary Discipline) Any penalized Player leaving the Penalty Box during a stoppage of play and during an altercation shall incur a Minor Penalty plus a Game Misconduct Penalty. The Minor Penalty plus the unexpired time remaining in their original penalty must be served by a replacement Player placed in the Penalty Box by the Coach of the offending Team. If a Player leaves the Penalty Box before their penalty is fully served, the Penalty Timekeeper shall note the time and signal the On-ice Officials who will stop play when the offending Player’s Team obtains “control of the puck”. An additional Minor Penalty must be served by this Player in addition to the time remaining in their original penalty (this unexpired time is calculated from the time they left the Penalty Box illegally). In the case of a Player returning to the ice before their time has expired through an error of the Penalty Timekeeper, they are not to serve an additional penalty, but must serve their unexpired time this unexpired time is calculated from the time they left the Penalty Box through the error of the Penalty Timekeeper. At a stoppage of play following the expiration of their penalties, if a Player or Players exiting the Penalty Box get involved in an altercation, those coming from the Penalty Box shall be assessed the penalties they incur in the altercation. Should a Player coming from the Penalty Box at a stoppage of play get involved with an opponent and the opponent is deemed to be the instigator of the altercation, then the Player coming from the Penalty Box would not be subject to the Game Misconduct Penalty. If deemed appropriate, Supplementary Discipline can be applied by the Proper Authorities at their discretion. (Rule 28 – Supplementary Discipline)The Penalty Timekeeper shall keep a correct record of all penalties imposed by the On-ice Game Officials, including the names of the Players penalized, the penalties assessed, the duration of each penalty and the time at which each penalty was imposed. This information shall also be recorded by the scorekeeper on the Official Game Sheet. The Penalty Timekeeper shall inform penalized Players and the Penalty Box Attendants as to the correct expiration time of all penalties. In the event of a malfunction of the Penalty Time Clock, the Game Clock shall be utilized to determine the expiration time of each penalty. Otherwise, the Penalty Time Clocks shall be the official timing device for all penalties that require a Team to play with less than five (5) Skaters. Players shall only be released from the Penalty Box when indicated by the Penalty Time Clock or as otherwise covered in the playing rules. The infraction of the rules for which each penalty has been imposed will be announced over the Public Address System as reported by the Referee. Where Players of both Teams are penalized at the same time, the penalty to the visiting Player will be announced first. In situations where multiple Game Misconduct Penalties have been assessed to any one (1) Player at the same stoppage of play, only one (1) Game Misconduct Penalty should be announced. Misconduct Penalties and coincident Major Penalties should not be recorded on the timing device (Penalty Time Clock) but such penalized Players should be alerted and released at the first stoppage of play following the expiration of their penalties. When a Player is assessed a Misconduct Penalty in addition to other penalties, the Misconduct Penalty shall only commence after all other penalties have been served (or washed out by the scoring of a goal). If a Player leaves the Penalty Box before the time has expired, the Penalty Timekeeper must note the time and notify the Referees at their first opportunity. It is the responsibility of the Penalty Timekeeper to ensure that penalized Players return to the Penalty Box before the puck is dropped for the start of a new period.

As there is a human factor involved in blowing the whistle to stop play, the Referee may deem the play to be stopped slightly prior to the whistle actually being blown. The fact that the puck may come loose or cross the Goal Line prior to the sound of the whistle has no bearing if the Referee has ruled that the play had been stopped prior to this happening. In the event of any dispute regarding time or the expiration of penalties, the matter shall be referred to the Referee for adjustment and their decision shall be final. They may use the Video Review Consultant to assist in rendering the final decision. (Rule 37 – Video Review) and (Rule 38 – Coach’s Challenge) The IIHF will designate an Off-ice Official to serve in the role of Video Review Consultant in every arena for every game. The Video Review Consultant will be located in a secluded area in the upper level of the building with an unobstructed view of both goals. The location must be large enough to seat four (4) people (Video Review Consultant, Video Review Technician, Officiating Coach and IIHF Officiating Representative) and must have space for necessary monitors, replay and recording equipment. The Video Review Consultant and Officiating Coach shall both have access to all replays that may be available from all available broadcasts of the game. The Video Review Consultant and Officiating Coach shall also be equipped with state-of-the-art communications systems that will allow direct and immediate access to the Off-ice Official(s) at the Penalty Box and the On-ice Official(s). ( » For more information refer to IIHF Technology Codes & Regulations.) Every goal shall be reviewed by the Video Review Consultant. If there is a need to delay the resumption of the play following an apparent goal, the Off-Ice Official at ice level will be alerted to signal one of the Referees to delay the Center-ice “face-off” for a moment. Once the Video Review Consultant has reviewed the video and confirmed that the goal is valid, the Off-Ice Official at ice level should signal to the Referee to resume play. If an expanded review is required on any potential goal, the Video Review Consultant shall instruct that the in-arena horn be sounded and the Public Address Announcer will make an announcement that the “play is under review.” Once the play has been reviewed and deemed a goal, the goal will be announced in the normal manner. If the review reveals that the goal should be disallowed, the Referee shall announce the reason for the disallowed goal. When the Video Review Consultant observes an incident involving a potential goal that was undetected by the On-ice Officials, the Off-ice Official will contact the Referee at the first stoppage of play and inform them that a review of the play is in progress. When a video review is initiated, the Public Address Announcer will make an announcement that “the play is under review.” Should the Video Review Consultant be able to determine that a goal has been scored through the use of video replay, and play on the ice has nonetheless continued, the Video Review Consultant shall instruct that the in-arena horn be sounded to stop play immediately, and the goal will be awarded. Should the first stoppage of play following an apparent goal coincide with the end of a period, the On-ice Official(s) will instruct both Teams to remain at their respective Players’ Bench until the Video Review of the play can be completed. If the review reveals that the goal should be counted, the clock (including penalty time clocks, if applicable) shall be reset to the time the goal was scored. If the review reveals that no goal was scored, no adjustment to the time clock(s) will be made. Only one goal can be awarded at any stoppage of play. If  an  apparent goal was scored by Team A and is subsequently confirmed as a goal by Video Review,  any goal scored by Team B during the period of time between the apparent goal by Team A and the stoppage of play (Team B’s goal), the Team B goal will not be awarded. If the apparent goal by Team A is deemed to have entered the goal illegally (e.g., a “distinct kicking motion”), the goal will be disallowed. No goal will be awarded to Team B either in this circumstance since the play should have been stopped at the time of the apparent goal. The clock (including penalty time clocks, if applicable) shall be reset to the time of Team A’s apparent goal – whether awarded or disallowed. Any penalties signaled during the period of time between the apparent goal and the next stoppage of play shall be assessed in the normal manner, except when a Minor Penalty is to be assessed to the Team scored upon and is therefore nullified by the scoring of the goal – refer to (Rule 16.2. – Minor Penalties) (Rule 18.2. – Double-minor Penalties) If an infraction happens after the first stoppage of play following an apparent goal (infraction after the whistle) by either Team, it is assessed and served in the normal manner regardless as to the decision rendered by Video Review. When the Referee indicates there is a Video Review in progress, all Players (with the exception of the Goalkeepers) should proceed to their respective Players’ Bench immediately, and failure to do so may result in a Game Misconduct Penalty for offending Player(s) and shall be reported to the Proper Authorities. Any potential goal requiring Video Review must be reviewed prior to and/or during the next stoppage of play. No goal may be awarded (or disallowed) as a result of a Video Review once the play has resumed. The Video Review Consultant will connect directly with the Referee(s) at ice level to assist with the review of any close play or disputed goal. The On-ice Officials (Referees or Linespersons) decision shall be final. ( » For more information refer to IIHF Technology Codes & Regulations.) The following situations are subject to Video Review: (I) Puck crossing the Goal Line (II) Puck in the net prior to the goal frame being dislodged or if the criteria’s for allowing a goal after a dislodged net is met. (III) Puck in the net prior to (or after) the expiration of time at the end of a period (IV) With the use of a foot/skate, a “distinct kicking motion” was evident (V) Puck deliberately directed, batted, or thrown into the net by an attacking Player by any means (and with any part of their body) other than with their stick – excl. foot/skate – see (IV) above. (VI) Puck deflected directly into the net of an On-ice Official (VII) Puck struck or deflected into the net with a high-stick, above the height of the crossbar (VIII) Puck entering the net in a proper manner through goal mouth (ensuring puck did not enter net improperly through net meshing or underneath the net frame, etc.) (IX) Puck entering the net as the culmination of a continuous play where the result of the play was unaffected by any whistle blown by the Referee upon their losing sight of the puck; and (X) The legitimacy of all potential goals on “Penalty Shot” or “Penalty Shot” Shootout attempts to ensure compliance with applicable rules (e.g., Goalkeeper leaving crease prior to puck touch at Center ice, Goalkeeper throwing stick, Goalkeeper dislodging goal, shooter cradling puck above the normal height of the shoulders, shooter performing illegal “spin-o-rama” move, Skater’s continued forward advancement of puck, “double-tap”/ “rebound”, etc.) The Coach's Challenge according to Rule 38 – Coach’s Challenge will only be used at selected IIHF Championships. Additional Video Review when Coach’s Challenge is not used: (XI) The Referees may review at their own discretion scoring plays involving potential “Interference on the Goalkeeper”. (Rule 69 – Interference on the Goalkeeper) ( » For more information regarding implementation of video review system refer to IIHF Event Codes.) Plays that involve a puck entering the net as a direct result of a “distinct kicking motion” shall be ruled “no goal”. A “distinct kicking motion,” for purposes of Video Review, is one where the video makes clear that an attacking Player has deliberately propelled the puck with a kick of their foot or skate and the puck subsequently enters the net.  A goal cannot be scored on a play where an attacking Player propels the puck with their skate into the net (even by means of a subsequent deflection off another Player, unless from a stick of a skater) using a “distinct kicking motion”. A goal also cannot be scored on a play where an attacking Player kicks any equipment (stick, glove, helmet, etc.) at the puck, including kicking the blade of their own stick, causing the puck to cross the Goal Line. A puck that deflects into the net off an attacking Player’s skate who does not use a “distinct kicking motion” shall be ruled a “good goal”. A puck that is directed into the net by an attacking Players’ skate shall also be ruled a “good goal”, as long as no “distinct kicking motion” is evident. (Rule 49.2. – Kicking / Goals) The determining factor for high stick Video Review is where the puck makes contact with the stick in relation to the crossbar. If the puck makes contact with a portion of the stick that is at or below the level of the crossbar (despite some other portion of the stick being above the crossbar) and enters the goal, the goal shall be allowed. (Rule 80.3. – High-sticking the Puck) Video Review may be used to establish the correct time on the clock. Any loss of time on the game or penalty clocks due to a false “face-off”, a “face-off” violation or a puck going out of play must be replaced. The Video Review Consultant may be consulted or may intervene with Onand Off-Ice Officials directly, as appropriate, to ensure that any loss of time on the game or penalty clocks due to these situations is properly replaced. (Rule 76.8 – Face-off Procedure / Verification of Time) (Rule 85.7 – Puck Out of Bounds / Verification of Time) In the event of any dispute regarding time, the matter shall be referred to the Video Review Consultant for adjustment, and its decision shall be final. The Game Timekeeper shall assist to verify game time via an additional timing device (IIHF-approved stopwatch). In the event a Video Review shows that a goal was scored prior to the play being stopped, the Video Review Consultant will inform the Game Timekeeper and Official Scorekeeper of the time of the goal and the amount of playing time left to be re-set on the Game Clock and penalty time clocks (if applicable). (Rule 34.7 – Game Timekeeper / Verification of Time) In IIHF Championships where Video Review is not used, Goal Judges behind both nets shall be used. There shall be one Goal Judge situated behind each goal (or in an area designated and approved by the IIHF), in properly protected areas, if possible, so that there can be no interference with their activities. They shall not change goals during the game. The Goal Judge shall signal, normally by means of red light, a decision as to whether the puck passed between the Goal Posts and entirely over the Goal Line. The only decision the Goal Judge must make is whether the puck actually entered the net, not how or when it went in. The light must be illuminated for a period of five (5) seconds each time the puck enters the net regardless of circumstances. It is up to the Referee to make the final decision. ( » For more information refer to IIHF Technology Codes & Regulations.)Apparent goals shall be disallowed by the Referee and the appropriate announcement made by the Public Address Announcer for the following reasons: (I) When the puck has been directed with any part of their body (excl. skates), batted or thrown into the net by an attacking Player other than with a stick. When this occurs, if it is deemed to be done deliberately, then the decision shall be NO GOAL. A goal cannot be scored when the puck has been deliberately batted with any part of the attacking Player’s body into the net (Rule 78.4 – Scoring a Goal) (II) When the puck has been kicked using a distinct kicking motion (Rule 49.2 – Kicking) (III) When the puck has deflected directly into the net off an official (Rule 85.4 – Puck Striking Official) (IV) When a goal has been scored and an ineligible Player is on the ice (Rule 68.5 – Disallowed Goal) (V) When an attacking Player has interfered with a Goalkeeper in their Goal Crease (Rule 69.1 – Interference on the Goalkeeper) (VI) When the puck has entered the net after making contact with an attacking Player’s stick that is above the height of the crossbar. Where the puck makes contact with the stick is the determining factor (Rule 80.3 – Disallowed Goal) (VII) When Video Review confirms the scoring of a goal at one end of the ice, any goal scored at the other end on the same play must be disallowed (Rule 37.2 – Video Review) (VIII) When a Linesperson reports a Double-minor Penalty for high-sticking or a Major Penalty to the Referee following the scoring of a goal by the offending Team, the goal must be disallowed, and the appropriate penalty assessed (Rule 32.4 – Reporting to Referee) (IX) When a Goalkeeper has been pushed into the net together with the puck after making a save (Rule 69.7 – Rebounds and Loose Pucks) (X) When the net becomes displaced accidentally. The goal frame is considered to be displaced if either or both goal pegs are no longer in their respective holes in the ice, or the net has come completely off one or both pegs, prior to or as the puck enters the goal. However, if this occurs as a result of the actions of a defending player, refer to (Rule 63.7 – Awarded Goal) (XI) During the delayed calling of a penalty, the offending Team cannot score unless the non-offending Team shoots the puck into their own net. This shall mean that a deflection off an offending Player or any physical action by an offending Player that may cause the puck to enter the non-offending Team’s goal, shall not be considered a legal goal. Play shall be stopped before the puck enters the net (whenever possible) and the signaled penalty assessed to the offending Team; (XII) When the Referee deems the play has been stopped, even if they have not physically had the opportunity to stop play by blowing their whistle; (XIII) Any goal scored, other than as covered by the official rules, shall not be allowed.",

The helmet should be attached in such a way that it cannot fall off. If it falls off and has not been removed by an opponent Player, it has not been attached correctly. A Player on the ice whose helmet comes off during play has to exit the playing surface immediately. A player on the ice whose helmet comes off during play is not allowed to retrieve and put their helmet back on their head – for this they have to proceed to their Players’ Bench and exit the playing surface. If a Player does not comply with this rule, they shall be assessed a Minor Penalty without a warning (Rule 12 – Illegal Equipment) If the Player returns to their Players’ Bench to be substituted for, they may only return to the ice during play with a helmet (with the chin strap properly fastened). No Player may exit the Penalty Box during play without a helmet (with the chin strap properly fastened). Should they do so, the play shall be stopped once their Team has gained control of the puck and a Minor Penalty shall be assessed to the offending Player. If a Player’s chin strap becomes unfastened during game action, but the helmet stays on their head, they may continue to play until the next stoppage or until they leave the ice. A Player who intentionally removes an opponent’s helmet during play shall be assessed a Minor Penalty for “Roughing”. (Rule 51 – Roughing) When a goalkeeper is hit on the face mask by a hard shot with the puck and the Referee believes the Goalkeeper is or may be dazed by that hard shot, the Referee may stop play for safety reasons, if there is no immediate scoring chance for the attacking Team. When a Goalkeeper has lost their helmet and/or face mask and their Team has control of the puck, play shall be stopped immediately to allow the Goalkeeper the opportunity to recollect their helmet and/or face mask.

The goal frame shall be considered in its proper position when at least a portion of the flexible peg(s) are still inside both the Goal post and the hole in the ice.

A Player without a stick may participate in the game. A Player whose stick is “broken” may participate in the game provided they drop the “broken stick”. A Minor Penalty shall be imposed for an infraction of this rule. A Player who has “lost” or has “broken their stick” may receive a replacement stick by having one handed to them from their own Players’ Bench, by having one handed to them by a Teammate on the ice or by picking up their own unbroken stick or that of a Teammate from the ice. A Player will be penalized if they throw, toss, slide or shoot a stick to a Teammate (Skater) on the ice, or if they pick up and play with an opponent’s stick. A Player may not participate in the play using a Goalkeeper’s stick. A Minor Penalty shall be imposed for an infraction of this rule. A Player using a stick thrown on the ice from the Players’ Bench or Penalty Box will not receive a penalty. However, the offending Team responsible for throwing the stick will receive a Bench Minor Penalty.Apparent goals shall be disallowed by the Referee and the appropriate announcement made by the Public Address Announcer for the following reasons: (I) When the puck has been directed with any part of their body (excl. skates), batted or thrown into the net by an attacking Player other than with a stick. When this occurs, if it is deemed to be done deliberately, then the decision shall be NO GOAL. A goal cannot be scored when the puck has been deliberately batted with any part of the attacking Player’s body into the net (Rule 78.4 – Scoring a Goal) (II) When the puck has been kicked using a distinct kicking motion (Rule 49.2 – Kicking) (III) When the puck has deflected directly into the net off an official (Rule 85.4 – Puck Striking Official) (IV) When a goal has been scored and an ineligible Player is on the ice (Rule 68.5 – Disallowed Goal) (V) When an attacking Player has interfered with a Goalkeeper in their Goal Crease (Rule 69.1 – Interference on the Goalkeeper) (VI) When the puck has entered the net after making contact with an attacking Player’s stick that is above the height of the crossbar. Where the puck makes contact with the stick is the determining factor (Rule 80.3 – Disallowed Goal) (VII) When Video Review confirms the scoring of a goal at one end of the ice, any goal scored at the other end on the same play must be disallowed (Rule 37.2 – Video Review) (VIII) When a Linesperson reports a Double-minor Penalty for high-sticking or a Major Penalty to the Referee following the scoring of a goal by the offending Team, the goal must be disallowed, and the appropriate penalty assessed (Rule 32.4 – Reporting to Referee) (IX) When a Goalkeeper has been pushed into the net together with the puck after making a save (Rule 69.7 – Rebounds and Loose Pucks) (X) When the net becomes displaced accidentally. The goal frame is considered to be displaced if either or both goal pegs are no longer in their respective holes in the ice, or the net has come completely off one or both pegs, prior to or as the puck enters the goal. However, if this occurs as a result of the actions of a defending player, refer to (Rule 63.7 – Awarded Goal) (XI) During the delayed calling of a penalty, the offending Team cannot score unless the non-offending Team shoots the puck into their own net. This shall mean that a deflection off an offending Player or any physical action by an offending Player that may cause the puck to enter the non-offending Team’s goal, shall not be considered a legal goal. Play shall be stopped before the puck enters the net (whenever possible) and the signaled penalty assessed to the offending Team; (XII) When the Referee deems the play has been stopped, even if they have not physically had the opportunity to stop play by blowing their whistle; (XIII) Any goal scored, other than as covered by the official rules, shall not be allowed.",

For every “Delayed Off-side” situation, including an “intentional off-side”, the Linesperson will raise their non-whistle arm. They will allow play to continue and, if a stoppage of play occurs, there will be four possible “face-off” locations: (I) If carried over the Blue Line – “face-off” outside the Blue Line. (II) If shot into the Attacking Zone (or errant pass) – nearest Face-off Spot in the zone from which the pass or shot originated that gives the offending Team the least amount of “territorial advantage” (even if deflected off an attacking or defending Player or an official). (III) If the defending Player is pressured or about to be checked by an attacking Player – nearest Face-off Spot in the zone from which the pass or shot originated that gives the offending Team the least amount of “territorial advantage” (even if deflected off an attacking or defending Player or an official). (IV) If deemed to be an “intentional off-side” – Face-off Spot in the offending Team’s End Zone. When the Linesperson signals a “Delayed Off-side” and a defending Player shoots the puck which goes over the Protection Glass and out of play, the ensuing “face-off” shall be conducted at one of the Defending Zone End Zone Face-off Spots and the defending Player would be assessed a Minor Penalty. (Rule 63 – Delaying the Game) When the Linesperson signals a “Delayed Off-side” and the original shot deflects off a defending Player and out of play, the ensuing “face-off” shall take place at the nearest Face-off Spot in the zone from where the puck was shot. When the defending Team is about to be penalized in the Defending Zone and the Linesperson has a “Delayed Off-side” signaled against the attacking Team on the same play, the ensuing “face-off” shall be conducted at one of the Defending Zone End Zone Face-off Spots.",

If two (2) rule violations are the reason for the stoppage of play (e.g.: “high-sticking the puck” and “intentional off-side”), the ensuing “face-off location” shall be determined as the spot that provides the least amount of “territorial advantage” to the offending Team. When the play is stopped for any reason not specifically attributable to either Team while the puck is in the Neutral Zone, the ensuing “face-off” shall be conducted at the nearest Face-off Spot outside the Blue Line whenever possible. When it is unclear as to which of the four (4) Face-off Spots is the nearest, the spot that gives the Home Team the greatest “territorial advantage” in the Neutral Zone will be selected for the ensuing “face-off”. When Players are penalized at a stoppage of play so as to result in penalties being placed on the penalty time clock to one Team, the ensuing “face-off” shall be conducted at one of the two (2) Face-off Spots in the offending Team’s Defending Zone. There are only three (3) exceptions to this application: (I) when a penalty is assessed after the scoring of a goal – “face-off” shall be conducted at Center ice; (II) when a penalty is assessed at the end (or start) of a period – “face-off” shall be conducted at Center ice; (III) or when the defending Team is penalized, and the attacking Players enter the Attacking Zone beyond the outer edge of the End Zone Face-off Circle – “face-off” shall be conducted in the Neutral Zone. The Team awarded the “Power-Play” will have the choice of which End Zone spot the “face-off” will take place at to start the “Power-Play”. When an infringement of a rule has been committed by Players of both Teams in the play resulting in the stoppage, the ensuing “face-off” will be conducted at the nearest Face-off Spot in that zone. When stoppage occurs between the end Face-off Spots and near end of the Rink, the puck shall be faced-off at the end Face-off Spot on the side where the stoppage occurs unless otherwise expressly provided by these rules. No “face-off” shall be made within 4.50 m of the goal or side Boards nor anywhere other than at a Face-off Spot. When a goal is illegally scored as a result of a puck being deflected directly off an Official, the resulting “face-off” shall be made at the nearest Face-off Spot in the zone where the puck deflected off of the Official. When a goal is illegally scored by the attacking Team by “directing”, “batting”, “kicking” or “high-sticking” the puck into the goal, the resulting “face-off” shall take place in the Neutral Zone at the nearest Face-off Spot. When the game is stopped for any reason not specifically covered in the official rules, the puck must be “faced-off” at a Face-off Spot in the zone nearest to where it was last played. Following a stoppage of play, should one or both defensemen who are the “point Players” or any Player coming from the Players’ Bench of the attacking Team, enter into the Attacking Zone beyond the outer edge of the End Zone Face-off Circle during an altercation, “gathering or scrum”, the ensuing “face-off” shall take place in the Neutral Zone near the Blue Line of the defending Team. This rule also applies when an “icing”, an “intentional off-side”, or a penalty has been assessed, and the ensuing “face-off” is to be in the offending Team’s Defending Zone. Should any of the non-offending Players enter the Attacking Zone beyond the outer edge of the End Zone Face-off Circle during an altercation, “gathering or scrum”, the ensuing “face-off” shall take place in the Neutral Zone near the Blue Line of the defending Team. For a violation of (Rule 71 – Premature Substitution) the resulting “face-off” will take place at the Center ice Face-off Spot when play is stopped beyond the Center red line. When play is stopped prior to the Center red line, the resulting “face-off” shall be conducted at the nearest Face-off Spot in the zone where the play was stopped. When play is stopped for an injured Player, the ensuing “face-off” shall be conducted at the Face-off Spot in the zone nearest the location of the puck when the play was stopped. When the injured Player’s Team has “control of the puck” in the Attacking Zone, the “face-off” shall be conducted at one of the Face-off Spots outside the Blue Line in the Neutral Zone. When the injured Player is in their Defending Zone and the attacking Team is in “control of the puck” in the Attacking Zone, the “face-off” shall be conducted at one of the defending Team’s end-zone Face-off Spots.Batting the puck above the normal height of the shoulders with a stick is prohibited. When a puck is struck with a “high stick” and subsequently comes into the “possession and control” of a Player from the offending Team (including the Player who made contact with the puck), either directly or deflected off any Player or official, there shall be a whistle. When a puck has been contacted by a “high stick”, the play shall be permitted to continue, provided that: (I) The puck has been batted to an opponent (when a Player bats the puck to an opponent, the Referee shall give the “washout” signal immediately – otherwise, they will stop the play). (II) A Player of the defending side shall bat the puck into their own goal in which case the goal shall be allowed. Cradling the puck on the blade of the stick (“lacrosse style”) above the normal height of the shoulders shall be prohibited and a stoppage of play shall result. If this is done by a Player on a “Penalty Shot” or Shootout attempt, the shot shall be stopped immediately and considered complete. (Rule 60 – High-sticking)",

If the attacking Team is at fault and the play is stopped while the puck is in the Attacking Zone, the ensuing “face-off” must be moved to the nearest Face-off Spot in the Neutral Zone. When an attacking Player causes the puck to enter the opponent’s goal by contacting the puck above the height of the crossbar, either directly or deflected off any Player or official, the goal shall not be allowed. The determining factor is where the puck makes contact with the stick. If the puck makes contact with the stick at or below the level of the crossbar and enters the goal, this goal shall be allowed. A goal scored as a result of a defending Player striking the puck with their stick carried above the height of the crossbar of the goal frame into their own goal shall be allowed. The action of the Referee or Linesperson in dropping the puck between the sticks of two opposing Players to start or resume play is called a “face-off”. A “face-off” begins when the Official indicates the “location of the “face-off” and the Officials and Players take their appropriate positions. The “face-off” ends when the puck has been legally dropped. A Goalkeeper may not participate in a “face-off”. All “face-off” must be conducted on one of the nine (9) Face-off Spots located on the Rink. If two (2) rule violations are the reason for the stoppage of play (e.g.: “high-sticking the puck” and “intentional off-side”), the ensuing “face-off location” shall be determined as the spot that provides the least amount of “territorial advantage” to the offending Team. When the play is stopped for any reason not specifically attributable to either Team while the puck is in the Neutral Zone, the ensuing “face-off” shall be conducted at the nearest Face-off Spot outside the Blue Line whenever possible. When it is unclear as to which of the four (4) Face-off Spots is the nearest, the spot that gives the Home Team the greatest “territorial advantage” in the Neutral Zone will be selected for the ensuing “face-off”. When Players are penalized at a stoppage of play so as to result in penalties being placed on the penalty time clock to one Team, the ensuing “face-off” shall be conducted at one of the two (2) Face-off Spots in the offending Team’s Defending Zone. There are only three (3) exceptions to this application: (I) when a penalty is assessed after the scoring of a goal – “face-off” shall be conducted at Center ice; (II) when a penalty is assessed at the end (or start) of a period – “face-off” shall be conducted at Center ice; (III) or when the defending Team is penalized, and the attacking Players enter the Attacking Zone beyond the outer edge of the End Zone Face-off Circle – “face-off” shall be conducted in the Neutral Zone. The Team awarded the “Power-Play” will have the choice of which End Zone spot the “face-off” will take place at to start the “Power-Play”. When an infringement of a rule has been committed by Players of both Teams in the play resulting in the stoppage, the ensuing “face-off” will be conducted at the nearest Face-off Spot in that zone. When stoppage occurs between the end Face-off Spots and near end of the Rink, the puck shall be faced-off at the end Face-off Spot on the side where the stoppage occurs unless otherwise expressly provided by these rules. No “face-off” shall be made within 4.50 m of the goal or side Boards nor anywhere other than at a Face-off Spot. When a goal is illegally scored as a result of a puck being deflected directly off an Official, the resulting “face-off” shall be made at the nearest Face-off Spot in the zone where the puck deflected off of the Official. When a goal is illegally scored by the attacking Team by “directing”, “batting”, “kicking” or “high-sticking” the puck into the goal, the resulting “face-off” shall take place in the Neutral Zone at the nearest Face-off Spot. When the game is stopped for any reason not specifically covered in the official rules, the puck must be “faced-off” at a Face-off Spot in the zone nearest to where it was last played. Following a stoppage of play, should one or both defensemen who are the “point Players” or any Player coming from the Players’ Bench of the attacking Team, enter into the Attacking Zone beyond the outer edge of the End Zone Face-off Circle during an altercation, “gathering or scrum”, the ensuing “face-off” shall take place in the Neutral Zone near the Blue Line of the defending Team. This rule also applies when an “icing”, an “intentional off-side”, or a penalty has been assessed, and the ensuing “face-off” is to be in the offending Team’s Defending Zone. Should any of the non-offending Players enter the Attacking Zone beyond the outer edge of the End Zone Face-off Circle during an altercation, “gathering or scrum”, the ensuing “face-off” shall take place in the Neutral Zone near the Blue Line of the defending Team. For a violation of (Rule 71 – Premature Substitution) the resulting “face-off” will take place at the Center ice Face-off Spot when play is stopped beyond the Center red line. When play is stopped prior to the Center red line, the resulting “face-off” shall be conducted at the nearest Face-off Spot in the zone where the play was stopped. When play is stopped for an injured Player, the ensuing “face-off” shall be conducted at the Face-off Spot in the zone nearest the location of the puck when the play was stopped. When the injured Player’s Team has “control of the puck” in the Attacking Zone, the “face-off” shall be conducted at one of the Face-off Spots outside the Blue Line in the Neutral Zone. When the injured Player is in their Defending Zone and the attacking Team is in “control of the puck” in the Attacking Zone, the “face-off” shall be conducted at one of the defending Team’s end-zone Face-off Spots. As soon as the line change procedure has been completed by the Referee and they lower their hand to indicate no further changes, the Linesperson conducting the “face-off” shall blow their whistle. This will signal to both Teams that they have no more than five (5) seconds to line up for the ensuing “face-off”. At the end of the five (5) seconds (or sooner if both centers are ready), the Linesperson will conduct a proper “face-off”. However if: (I) One or both centers are not positioned for the “face-off”, (II) One or both centers refrain from placing their stick on the ice, (III) Any Player has encroached into the Face-off Circle, (IV) Any Player makes physical contact with an opponent, (V) Any Player who lines up for the “face-off” in an off-side position, or (VI) One of the centers wins the face-off by using the skates, the Linesperson shall have the offending center(s) may assess a warning for a “face-off” violation prior to dropping the puck. In the last two (2) minutes of regulation time or any time in Overtime, the Linesperson will still blow their whistle to initiate the “face-off”, but the five (5) second time limit will not be enforced. However, Players must abide by the verbal directions given by the Linesperson in their attempt to conduct a fast and fair “face-off”. The puck shall be faced-off by the Referee or the Linesperson dropping the puck on the ice between the sticks of the Players facing-off. Players facing-off will stand squarely facing their opponent’s end of the Rink approximately one stick length apart with the blade of their sticks on the ice. When the “face-off” takes place at any of the nine Face-off Spots, the Players taking part shall take their position so that they will stand squarely facing their opponent’s end of the Rink, and clear of the ice markings (where applicable). The sticks of both Players facing-off shall have the blade on the ice, within the designated white area. At the eight (8) Face-off Spots (excluding Center ice Faceoff Spot), the defending Player shall place their stick within the designated white area first followed immediately by the attacking Player. When the “face-off” is conducted at the Center ice Face-off Spot, the visiting Player shall place their stick on the ice first. If a Player facing-off fails to take their proper position immediately when directed by the On-ice Official, the Official may assess a warning for a “face-off” violation. If a center is not at the designated “face-off” area once the five (5) second time limit has elapsed, the Linesperson will drop the puck immediately. If the center is back from the Face-off Spot, is “quarterbacking” or refuses to come into the “face-off” area when instructed to do so by the Linesperson, or the center is simply slow getting to the Face-off Spot when the five (5) seconds has elapsed, the puck shall be dropped. If the center attempts to arrive at the Face-off Spot just as the five seconds elapses in an attempt to gain an advantage to win the “face-off”, the center will be warned by the Linesperson that they have committed a “face-off” violation. If a Player received a warning for a “face-off” violation, they must come into position quickly or risk having the puck dropped by the Linesperson without the Player being set or will result in a Bench Minor Penalty for “Delay of Game” for a second “face-off” violation during the same “face-off”. No other Player shall be allowed to enter the Face-off Circle or come within 4.5 m of the Players facing-off. All Players must stand on-side on all “face-offs”. During end-zone “face-offs”, all other Players on the ice must position their bodies on their own side of the restraining lines marked on the outer edge of the Face-off Circles. If a Player other than the Player taking the “face-off” moves into the Face-off Circle prior to the dropping of the puck, then the offending Team taking the “face-off” shall receive a warning for a “face-off” violation. Players on the attacking Team (exclusive of the center) must establish their position first and then the defending Team may counter and hold its position until the puck is dropped. A violation of this procedure shall be treated as “face-off” encroachment and the Linesperson shall assess a warning for a “face-off” violation to the offending Team. Should an attacking Player attempt to establish a new position prior to the “face-off”, and the defending center steps back from the Face-off Spot in order to reposition their Teammates, the “face-off” violation shall be charged to the attacking Team as they must establish their position first. If a center should move prematurely prior to the “face-off”, or if the Referee or Linesperson shall have dropped the puck unfairly, the “face-off” shall be considered a “face-off” violation. A warning shall be issued to the offending Team and the “face-off” must be conducted again. When two (2) “face-off” violations” have been committed by the same Team during the same “face-off”, this Team shall be penalized with a Bench Minor Penalty to the offending Team. This penalty shall be announced as a “Bench Minor Penalty for “Delay of Game” – Face-off Violation.” “Face-off” violations shall be summarized as follows (any of the four (4) On-ice Officials may identify a “face-off” violation): (I) Encroachment by any Player other than the center into the “face-off” area prior to the puck being dropped. Players on the perimeter of the Face-off Circle must keep both skates outside the Face-off Circle – skate contact with the line is permitted. If a Player's skate crosses the line into the Face-off Circle prior to the drop of the puck, this shall be deemed as a “face-off” violation. A Player's stick may be inside the Face-off Circle provided there is no physical contact with their opponent or their opponent's stick. (II) Encroachment by any Player into the area between the hash marks on the outer edges of the Face-off Circle prior to the puck being dropped. Players must also ensure that both of their skates do not cross their respective hash marks. Contact with the line with their skate is permitted. If a Player's skate crosses the line into the area between the hash marks prior to the drop of the puck, this shall be deemed as a “face-off” violation. A Player's stick may be inside the area between the hash marks provided there is no physical contact with their opponent or their opponent's stick. (III) Any physical contact with an opponent prior to the puck being dropped. If either Player taking the “face-off” makes helmet-to-helmet contact with their opponent, they must receive a first “face-off” violation warning. If the Linesperson cannot differentiate which Player initiated the contact, both Players must receive a first “face-off” violation warning. (IV) Failure by either center taking the “face-off” to “properly position themself behind the restraining lines” or place their stick on the ice – as outlined in Rule 76.4 – Face-off Procedure – Centers. \"Properly position themself behind the restraining lines\" shall mean that the center must place their feet on either side of the restraining lines that are parallel to the side Boards (contact with the lines is permissible), and the toe of the blade of their skates must not cross over the restraining lines that are perpendicular to the side Boards as they approach the Face-off Spot. The blade of the stick must then be placed on the ice, at least the toe of the blade of the stick, in the designated white area of the Face-off Spot and must remain there until the puck is dropped. (V) Failure to comply with this positioning and “face-off” procedure will result in a “face-off” violation. Whenever a Team has committed two (2) “face-off” violations during the same “face-off”, the Referee shall immediately assess the offending Team a Bench Minor Penalty for “Delay of Game”. This penalty shall be announced as a Bench Minor Penalty for Delay of Game – Face-off Violation. Players who are late to the “face-off” location and therefore in an off-side position for the ensuing “face-off” will be warned once in the game by the Referee. This warning will also be given to the offending Team’s Coach. In this situation, the offending Team’s center will not receive a warning for a “face-off” violation. Any subsequent violation shall result in a Bench Minor Penalty for “Delay of Game” being assessed to the offending Team. This penalty shall be announced as a “Bench Minor Penalty for “Delay of Game” – Slow Proceeding to Face-off Location. In the conduct of any “face-off” at any of the nine (9) Face-off Spots on the playing surface, no Player facing-off shall make any physical contact with their opponent’s body by means of their own body or by their stick except in the course of playing the puck after the “face-off” has been completed. For violation of this rule, the Referee may, at their discretion impose a Minor Penalty or penalties on the Player(s) whose action(s) caused the “physical contact”. Nonetheless, this “physical contact” prior to the dropping of the puck shall be deemed as a “face-off” violation and the center will be warned by the Linesperson that the Team has committed a “face-off” violation and any subsequent violation will result in a Bench Minor Penalty for “Delay of Game” – “face-off” violation being assessed. “Face-off” encroachment may be applied during “face-offs” at any of the nine (9) Face-off Spots on the playing surface However, since no such lines are painted on the ice at the four (4) Face-off Spots adjacent to the Blue Lines, Linespersons shall use their judgment as to whether or not a violation has occurred. All Players, other than the centers, shall be uniformly back from the “face-off” location similar to being outside the Face-off Circle for “face-offs” in the End Zones. No substitution of Players shall be permitted until the “face-off” has been completed and play has resumed except when a penalty is imposed which affects the on-ice strength of either Team. Should an On-ice Official notice that the defending Team has not placed enough Players on the ice for the ensuing “face-off”, the Referee in the Neutral Zone shall be notified and they will instruct the offending Team to place another Player(s) on the ice. If, in the opinion of the Referee that this is being done as a “stalling tactic”, they will issue a warning to the offending Team’s Coach and any subsequent violations shall result in the assessment of a Bench Minor Penalty for “Delay of Game”. Should an On-ice Official notice that the attacking Team has not placed enough Players on the ice for the ensuing “face-off”, the Linesperson will proceed with conducting the “face-off” in the normal manner. The attacking Team must ensure they put the appropriate number of Players on the ice at all times. Any loss of time on the game or penalty clocks due to a false “face-off” or a “face-off” violation must be replaced. The Video Review Consultant may be consulted to ensure the time is accurately replaced. (Rule 37.6 – Video Review to verify time on clock) The whistle will not be blown by the Official to start play. Playing time will commence from the instant the puck is “faced-off” and will stop when the whistle is blown, or a goal is scored.",

A goal scored as a result of a defending Player striking the puck with their stick carried above the height of the crossbar of the goal frame into their own goal shall be allowed. The IIHF will designate an Off-ice Official to serve in the role of Video Review Consultant in every arena for every game. The Video Review Consultant will be located in a secluded area in the upper level of the building with an unobstructed view of both goals. The location must be large enough to seat four (4) people (Video Review Consultant, Video Review Technician, Officiating Coach and IIHF Officiating Representative) and must have space for necessary monitors, replay and recording equipment. The Video Review Consultant and Officiating Coach shall both have access to all replays that may be available from all available broadcasts of the game. The Video Review Consultant and Officiating Coach shall also be equipped with state-of-the-art communications systems that will allow direct and immediate access to the Off-ice Official(s) at the Penalty Box and the On-ice Official(s). ( » For more information refer to IIHF Technology Codes & Regulations.) Every goal shall be reviewed by the Video Review Consultant. If there is a need to delay the resumption of the play following an apparent goal, the Off-Ice Official at ice level will be alerted to signal one of the Referees to delay the Center-ice “face-off” for a moment. Once the Video Review Consultant has reviewed the video and confirmed that the goal is valid, the Off-Ice Official at ice level should signal to the Referee to resume play. If an expanded review is required on any potential goal, the Video Review Consultant shall instruct that the in-arena horn be sounded and the Public Address Announcer will make an announcement that the “play is under review.” Once the play has been reviewed and deemed a goal, the goal will be announced in the normal manner. If the review reveals that the goal should be disallowed, the Referee shall announce the reason for the disallowed goal. When the Video Review Consultant observes an incident involving a potential goal that was undetected by the On-ice Officials, the Off-ice Official will contact the Referee at the first stoppage of play and inform them that a review of the play is in progress. When a video review is initiated, the Public Address Announcer will make an announcement that “the play is under review.” Should the Video Review Consultant be able to determine that a goal has been scored through the use of video replay, and play on the ice has nonetheless continued, the Video Review Consultant shall instruct that the in-arena horn be sounded to stop play immediately, and the goal will be awarded. Should the first stoppage of play following an apparent goal coincide with the end of a period, the On-ice Official(s) will instruct both Teams to remain at their respective Players’ Bench until the Video Review of the play can be completed. If the review reveals that the goal should be counted, the clock (including penalty time clocks, if applicable) shall be reset to the time the goal was scored. If the review reveals that no goal was scored, no adjustment to the time clock(s) will be made. Only one goal can be awarded at any stoppage of play. If  an  apparent goal was scored by Team A and is subsequently confirmed as a goal by Video Review,  any goal scored by Team B during the period of time between the apparent goal by Team A and the stoppage of play (Team B’s goal), the Team B goal will not be awarded. If the apparent goal by Team A is deemed to have entered the goal illegally (e.g., a “distinct kicking motion”), the goal will be disallowed. No goal will be awarded to Team B either in this circumstance since the play should have been stopped at the time of the apparent goal. The clock (including penalty time clocks, if applicable) shall be reset to the time of Team A’s apparent goal – whether awarded or disallowed. Any penalties signaled during the period of time between the apparent goal and the next stoppage of play shall be assessed in the normal manner, except when a Minor Penalty is to be assessed to the Team scored upon and is therefore nullified by the scoring of the goal – refer to (Rule 16.2. – Minor Penalties) (Rule 18.2. – Double-minor Penalties) If an infraction happens after the first stoppage of play following an apparent goal (infraction after the whistle) by either Team, it is assessed and served in the normal manner regardless as to the decision rendered by Video Review. When the Referee indicates there is a Video Review in progress, all Players (with the exception of the Goalkeepers) should proceed to their respective Players’ Bench immediately, and failure to do so may result in a Game Misconduct Penalty for offending Player(s) and shall be reported to the Proper Authorities. Any potential goal requiring Video Review must be reviewed prior to and/or during the next stoppage of play. No goal may be awarded (or disallowed) as a result of a Video Review once the play has resumed. The Video Review Consultant will connect directly with the Referee(s) at ice level to assist with the review of any close play or disputed goal. The On-ice Officials (Referees or Linespersons) decision shall be final. ( » For more information refer to IIHF Technology Codes & Regulations.) The following situations are subject to Video Review: (I) Puck crossing the Goal Line (II) Puck in the net prior to the goal frame being dislodged or if the criteria’s for allowing a goal after a dislodged net is met. (III) Puck in the net prior to (or after) the expiration of time at the end of a period (IV) With the use of a foot/skate, a “distinct kicking motion” was evident (V) Puck deliberately directed, batted, or thrown into the net by an attacking Player by any means (and with any part of their body) other than with their stick – excl. foot/skate – see (IV) above. (VI) Puck deflected directly into the net of an On-ice Official (VII) Puck struck or deflected into the net with a high-stick, above the height of the crossbar (VIII) Puck entering the net in a proper manner through goal mouth (ensuring puck did not enter net improperly through net meshing or underneath the net frame, etc.) (IX) Puck entering the net as the culmination of a continuous play where the result of the play was unaffected by any whistle blown by the Referee upon their losing sight of the puck; and (X) The legitimacy of all potential goals on “Penalty Shot” or “Penalty Shot” Shootout attempts to ensure compliance with applicable rules (e.g., Goalkeeper leaving crease prior to puck touch at Center ice, Goalkeeper throwing stick, Goalkeeper dislodging goal, shooter cradling puck above the normal height of the shoulders, shooter performing illegal “spin-o-rama” move, Skater’s continued forward advancement of puck, “double-tap”/ “rebound”, etc.) The Coach's Challenge according to Rule 38 – Coach’s Challenge will only be used at selected IIHF Championships. Additional Video Review when Coach’s Challenge is not used: (XI) The Referees may review at their own discretion scoring plays involving potential “Interference on the Goalkeeper”. (Rule 69 – Interference on the Goalkeeper) ( » For more information regarding implementation of video review system refer to IIHF Event Codes.) Plays that involve a puck entering the net as a direct result of a “distinct kicking motion” shall be ruled “no goal”. A “distinct kicking motion,” for purposes of Video Review, is one where the video makes clear that an attacking Player has deliberately propelled the puck with a kick of their foot or skate and the puck subsequently enters the net.  A goal cannot be scored on a play where an attacking Player propels the puck with their skate into the net (even by means of a subsequent deflection off another Player, unless from a stick of a skater) using a “distinct kicking motion”. A goal also cannot be scored on a play where an attacking Player kicks any equipment (stick, glove, helmet, etc.) at the puck, including kicking the blade of their own stick, causing the puck to cross the Goal Line. A puck that deflects into the net off an attacking Player’s skate who does not use a “distinct kicking motion” shall be ruled a “good goal”. A puck that is directed into the net by an attacking Players’ skate shall also be ruled a “good goal”, as long as no “distinct kicking motion” is evident. (Rule 49.2. – Kicking / Goals) The determining factor for high stick Video Review is where the puck makes contact with the stick in relation to the crossbar. If the puck makes contact with a portion of the stick that is at or below the level of the crossbar (despite some other portion of the stick being above the crossbar) and enters the goal, the goal shall be allowed. (Rule 80.3. – High-sticking the Puck) Video Review may be used to establish the correct time on the clock. Any loss of time on the game or penalty clocks due to a false “face-off”, a “face-off” violation or a puck going out of play must be replaced. The Video Review Consultant may be consulted or may intervene with Onand Off-Ice Officials directly, as appropriate, to ensure that any loss of time on the game or penalty clocks due to these situations is properly replaced. (Rule 76.8 – Face-off Procedure / Verification of Time) (Rule 85.7 – Puck Out of Bounds / Verification of Time) In the event of any dispute regarding time, the matter shall be referred to the Video Review Consultant for adjustment, and its decision shall be final. The Game Timekeeper shall assist to verify game time via an additional timing device (IIHF-approved stopwatch). In the event a Video Review shows that a goal was scored prior to the play being stopped, the Video Review Consultant will inform the Game Timekeeper and Official Scorekeeper of the time of the goal and the amount of playing time left to be re-set on the Game Clock and penalty time clocks (if applicable). (Rule 34.7 – Game Timekeeper / Verification of Time) In IIHF Championships where Video Review is not used, Goal Judges behind both nets shall be used. There shall be one Goal Judge situated behind each goal (or in an area designated and approved by the IIHF), in properly protected areas, if possible, so that there can be no interference with their activities. They shall not change goals during the game. The Goal Judge shall signal, normally by means of red light, a decision as to whether the puck passed between the Goal Posts and entirely over the Goal Line. The only decision the Goal Judge must make is whether the puck actually entered the net, not how or when it went in. The light must be illuminated for a period of five (5) seconds each time the puck enters the net regardless of circumstances. It is up to the Referee to make the final decision.

If two (2) rule violations are the reason for the stoppage of play (e.g.: “high-sticking the puck” and “intentional off-side”), the ensuing “face-off location” shall be determined as the spot that provides the least amount of “territorial advantage” to the offending Team. When the play is stopped for any reason not specifically attributable to either Team while the puck is in the Neutral Zone, the ensuing “face-off” shall be conducted at the nearest Face-off Spot outside the Blue Line whenever possible. When it is unclear as to which of the four (4) Face-off Spots is the nearest, the spot that gives the Home Team the greatest “territorial advantage” in the Neutral Zone will be selected for the ensuing “face-off”. When Players are penalized at a stoppage of play so as to result in penalties being placed on the penalty time clock to one Team, the ensuing “face-off” shall be conducted at one of the two (2) Face-off Spots in the offending Team’s Defending Zone. There are only three (3) exceptions to this application: (I) when a penalty is assessed after the scoring of a goal – “face-off” shall be conducted at Center ice; (II) when a penalty is assessed at the end (or start) of a period – “face-off” shall be conducted at Center ice; (III) or when the defending Team is penalized, and the attacking Players enter the Attacking Zone beyond the outer edge of the End Zone Face-off Circle – “face-off” shall be conducted in the Neutral Zone. The Team awarded the “Power-Play” will have the choice of which End Zone spot the “face-off” will take place at to start the “Power-Play”. When an infringement of a rule has been committed by Players of both Teams in the play resulting in the stoppage, the ensuing “face-off” will be conducted at the nearest Face-off Spot in that zone. When stoppage occurs between the end Face-off Spots and near end of the Rink, the puck shall be faced-off at the end Face-off Spot on the side where the stoppage occurs unless otherwise expressly provided by these rules. No “face-off” shall be made within 4.50 m of the goal or side Boards nor anywhere other than at a Face-off Spot. When a goal is illegally scored as a result of a puck being deflected directly off an Official, the resulting “face-off” shall be made at the nearest Face-off Spot in the zone where the puck deflected off of the Official. When a goal is illegally scored by the attacking Team by “directing”, “batting”, “kicking” or “high-sticking” the puck into the goal, the resulting “face-off” shall take place in the Neutral Zone at the nearest Face-off Spot. When the game is stopped for any reason not specifically covered in the official rules, the puck must be “faced-off” at a Face-off Spot in the zone nearest to where it was last played. Following a stoppage of play, should one or both defensemen who are the “point Players” or any Player coming from the Players’ Bench of the attacking Team, enter into the Attacking Zone beyond the outer edge of the End Zone Face-off Circle during an altercation, “gathering or scrum”, the ensuing “face-off” shall take place in the Neutral Zone near the Blue Line of the defending Team. This rule also applies when an “icing”, an “intentional off-side”, or a penalty has been assessed, and the ensuing “face-off” is to be in the offending Team’s Defending Zone. Should any of the non-offending Players enter the Attacking Zone beyond the outer edge of the End Zone Face-off Circle during an altercation, “gathering or scrum”, the ensuing “face-off” shall take place in the Neutral Zone near the Blue Line of the defending Team. For a violation of (Rule 71 – Premature Substitution) the resulting “face-off” will take place at the Center ice Face-off Spot when play is stopped beyond the Center red line. When play is stopped prior to the Center red line, the resulting “face-off” shall be conducted at the nearest Face-off Spot in the zone where the play was stopped. When play is stopped for an injured Player, the ensuing “face-off” shall be conducted at the Face-off Spot in the zone nearest the location of the puck when the play was stopped. When the injured Player’s Team has “control of the puck” in the Attacking Zone, the “face-off” shall be conducted at one of the Face-off Spots outside the Blue Line in the Neutral Zone. When the injured Player is in their Defending Zone and the attacking Team is in “control of the puck” in the Attacking Zone, the “face-off” shall be conducted at one of the defending Team’s end-zone Face-off Spots. Batting the puck above the normal height of the shoulders with a stick is prohibited. When a puck is struck with a “high stick” and subsequently comes into the “possession and control” of a Player from the offending Team (including the Player who made contact with the puck), either directly or deflected off any Player or official, there shall be a whistle. When a puck has been contacted by a “high stick”, the play shall be permitted to continue, provided that: (I) The puck has been batted to an opponent (when a Player bats the puck to an opponent, the Referee shall give the “washout” signal immediately – otherwise, they will stop the play). (II) A Player of the defending side shall bat the puck into their own goal in which case the goal shall be allowed. Cradling the puck on the blade of the stick (“lacrosse style”) above the normal height of the shoulders shall be prohibited and a stoppage of play shall result. If this is done by a Player on a “Penalty Shot” or Shootout attempt, the shot shall be stopped immediately and considered complete.

Should any Player of a Team, equal or superior in “numerical strength” (power-play) to the opposing Team, shoot, bat or deflect the puck from their own half of the ice beyond the Goal Line of the opposing Team, play shall be stopped. For the purpose of deflected pucks, this only applies when the puck was originally propelled down the ice by the offending Team. For the purpose of this rule, the point of last contact with the puck by the Team in possession shall be used to determine whether icing has occurred or not. As such, the Team in possession must “gain the line” in order for the icing to be nullified. “Gaining the line” shall mean that the puck, while on the Player’s stick (not the Player’s skate) must make contact with the center red line in order to nullify a potential icing. For the purpose of interpretation of the rule, there are two judgments required for \"icing the puck\". The Linesperson must first determine that the puck will cross the Goal Line. Once the Linesperson determines that the puck will cross the Goal Line, “icing” is completed upon the determination as to which Player (attacking or defending) would first touch the puck. This decision by the Linesperson will be made by no later than the instant the first Player reaches the End Zone “face-off” dots with the Player's skate being the determining factor. Should the puck be shot down the ice in such a manner that it travels around the Boards and/or back towards the End Zone “face-off” dots, the same procedure shall be in effect in that the Linesperson shall determine within a similar distance as to who will have touched the puck first. For clarification, the determining factor is which Player would first touch the puck, not which Player would first reach the End Zone “face-off” dots. If the “race for the puck” is too close to determine by the time the first Player reaches the End Zone “face-off” dots, “icing” shall be called. The puck striking or deflecting off an Official does not automatically nullify a potential “icing”. If there is no “race” for the puck, icing will be not called until a defending skater crosses its defending blue line and the puck crosses the goal line (not between the goal posts).A situation where an attacking Player (or Players) has (have) preceded the puck across the attacking Blue Line, but the defending Team is in a position to bring the puck back out of its Defending Zone without any delay or contact with an attacking Player or the attacking Players are in the process of clearing the Attacking Zone. If an “off-side” call is delayed, the Linesperson shall drop their arm to nullify the “off-side” violation and allow play to continue if: (I) All Players of the offending Team clear the zone at the same instant (skate contact with the Blue Line, \"3D\" judgement is not used in this situation) permitting the attacking Players to re-enter the Attacking Zone, or (II) the defending Team passes or carries the puck into the Neutral Zone. If, during the course of the “Delayed Off-side”, any member of the attacking Team touches the puck, attempts to “gain possession of a loose puck”, forces the defending puck carrier further back into their own zone, or who is about to make physical contact with the defending puck carrier, the Linesperson shall stop play for the “off-side” violation. If, during a “Delayed Off-side”, an attacking Player in the Attacking Zone elects to proceed to their Players’ Bench (which extends into the Attacking Zone) to be replaced by a Teammate, they shall be considered to have cleared the zone when both skates are off the ice and the Linesperson judges them to have left the playing surface. If their replacement comes onto the ice in the Attacking Zone, while the “Delayed Off-side” is still in effect, they too must clear the Attacking Zone. Once all attacking Players have cleared the Attacking Zone and the Linesperson have lowered their arm for the “Delayed Off-side”, all attacking Players may legally enter the Attacking Zone and pursue the puck.",

As such, the Team in possession must “gain the line” in order for the icing to be nullified. “Gaining the line” shall mean that the puck, while on the Player’s stick (not the Player’s skate) must make contact with the center red line in order to nullify a potential icing. For the purpose of interpretation of the rule, there are two judgments required for \"icing the puck\". The Linesperson must first determine that the puck will cross the Goal Line. Once the Linesperson determines that the puck will cross the Goal Line, “icing” is completed upon the determination as to which Player (attacking or defending) would first touch the puck. This decision by the Linesperson will be made by no later than the instant the first Player reaches the End Zone “face-off” dots with the Player's skate being the determining factor. Should the puck be shot down the ice in such a manner that it travels around the Boards and/or back towards the End Zone “face-off” dots, the same procedure shall be in effect in that the Linesperson shall determine within a similar distance as to who will have touched the puck first. For clarification, the determining factor is which Player would first touch the puck, not which Player would first reach the End Zone “face-off” dots. If the “race for the puck” is too close to determine by the time the first Player reaches the End Zone “face-off” dots, “icing” shall be called. The puck striking or deflecting off an Official does not automatically nullify a potential “icing”. If there is no “race” for the puck, icing will be not called until a defending skater crosses its defending blue line and the puck crosses the goal line (not between the goal posts).When the puck is shot and rebounds from the body or stick of an opponent in their own half of the ice so as to cross the Goal Line of the Player shooting, it shall not be considered “icing”. When a puck is shot by a Team from their own half of the ice and is deflected several times before crossing the center red line, icing shall be nullified if at least one of these deflections was off an opposing Player. If the puck shall go beyond the Goal Line in the opposite half of the ice directly from either of the Players while facing-off, it shall not be considered a violation of this rule. If, in the opinion of the Linesperson, any Player (other than the Goalkeeper) of the opposing Team is able to play the puck before it passes their Goal Line, but has not done so, play shall continue and the “icing” violation shall not be called. This includes the situation whereby the opposing Team, while in the process of making Player substitutions during the play, are able to play the puck, but choose not to do so to avoid being called for “too many Players on the ice”. “Icing” should not be called. If the puck touches any part of a Player of the opposing side, including their skates or their stick, or if it touches any part of the opposing Team’s Goalkeeper, including their skates or their stick, at any time before or after crossing the Goal Line, it shall not be considered “icing”. If a Goalkeeper takes any action to dislodge the puck from the back of the net, “icing” shall not be called.",

The Team awarded the “Power-Play” will have the choice of which End Zone spot the “face-off” will take place at to start the “Po­wer-Play”. When an infringement of a rule has been committed by Players of both Teams in the play resulting in the stoppage, the ensuing “face-off” will be conducted at the nearest Face-off Spot in that zone. (Rule 76 – FACE-OFF Locations)All “face-off” must be conducted on one of the nine (9) Face-off Spots located on the Rink. If two (2) rule violations are the reason for the stoppage of play (e.g.: “high-sticking the puck” and “intentional off-side”), the ensuing “face-off location” shall be determined as the spot that provides the least amount of “territorial advantage” to the offending Team. When the play is stopped for any reason not specifically attributable to either Team while the puck is in the Neutral Zone, the ensuing “face-off” shall be conducted at the nearest Face-off Spot outside the Blue Line whenever possible. When it is unclear as to which of the four (4) Face-off Spots is the nearest, the spot that gives the Home Team the greatest “territorial advantage” in the Neutral Zone will be selected for the ensuing “face-off”. When Players are penalized at a stoppage of play so as to result in penalties being placed on the penalty time clock to one Team, the ensuing “face-off” shall be conducted at one of the two (2) Face-off Spots in the offending Team’s Defending Zone.

When stoppage occurs between the end Face-off Spots and near end of the Rink, the puck shall be faced-off at the end Face-off Spot on the side where the stoppage occurs unless otherwise expressly provided by these rules. No “face-off” shall be made within 4.50 m of the goal or side Boards nor anywhere other than at a Face-off Spot. When a goal is illegally scored as a result of a puck being deflected directly off an Official, the resulting “face-off” shall be made at the nearest Face-off Spot in the zone where the puck deflected off of the Official. When a goal is illegally scored by the attacking Team by “directing”, “batting”, “kicking” or “high-sticking” the puck into the goal, the resulting “face-off” shall take place in the Neutral Zone at the nearest Face-off Spot. When the game is stopped for any reason not specifically covered in the official rules, the puck must be “faced-off” at a Face-off Spot in the zone nearest to where it was last played. Following a stoppage of play, should one or both defensemen who are the “point Players” or any Player coming from the Players’ Bench of the attacking Team, enter into the Attacking Zone beyond the outer edge of the End Zone Face-off Circle during an altercation, “gathering or scrum”, the ensuing “face-off” shall take place in the Neutral Zone near the Blue Line of the defending Team. This rule also applies when an “icing”, an “intentional off-side”, or a penalty has been assessed, and the ensuing “face-off” is to be in the offending Team’s Defending Zone. Should any of the non-offending Players enter the Attacking Zone beyond the outer edge of the End Zone Face-off Circle during an altercation, “gathering or scrum”, the ensuing “face-off” shall take place in the Neutral Zone near the Blue Line of the defending Team. For a violation of (Rule 71 – Premature Substitution) the resulting “face-off” will take place at the Center ice Face-off Spot when play is stopped beyond the Center red line.

When play is stopped for an injured Player, the ensuing “face-off” shall be conducted at the Face-off Spot in the zone nearest the location of the puck when the play was stopped. When the injured Player’s Team has “control of the puck” in the Attacking Zone, the “face-off” shall be conducted at one of the Face-off Spots outside the Blue Line in the Neutral Zone.

For the purpose of deflected pucks, this only applies when the puck was originally propelled down the ice by the offending Team. For the purpose of this rule, the point of last contact with the puck by the Team in possession shall be used to determine whether icing has occurred or not. As such, the Team in possession must “gain the line” in order for the icing to be nullified. “Gaining the line” shall mean that the puck, while on the Player’s stick (not the Player’s skate) must make contact with the center red line in order to nullify a potential icing. For the purpose of interpretation of the rule, there are two judgments required for \"icing the puck\". The Linesperson must first determine that the puck will cross the Goal Line. Once the Linesperson determines that the puck will cross the Goal Line, “icing” is completed upon the determination as to which Player (attacking or defending) would first touch the puck. This decision by the Linesperson will be made by no later than the instant the first Player reaches the End Zone “face-off” dots with the Player's skate being the determining factor. Should the puck be shot down the ice in such a manner that it travels around the Boards and/or back towards the End Zone “face-off” dots, the same procedure shall be in effect in that the Linesperson shall determine within a similar distance as to who will have touched the puck first. For clarification, the determining factor is which Player would first touch the puck, not which Player would first reach the End Zone “face-off” dots. If the “race for the puck” is too close to determine by the time the first Player reaches the End Zone “face-off” dots, “icing” shall be called. The puck striking or deflecting off an Official does not automatically nullify a potential “icing”. If there is no “race” for the puck, icing will be not called until a defending skater crosses its defending blue line and the puck crosses the goal line (not between the goal posts).",

Should an infraction of the rules which would call for a Minor, Bench Minor, Major, Misconduct or Game Misconduct be committed by Player or Team Personnel of the Team not in control of the puck, the Referee shall raise their arm to signal the delayed calling of a penalty. When the Team to be penalized gains control of the puck, the Referees will blow their whistle to stop play and impose the penalty on the offending Player or Team. When a Player, Team Manager, Coach or team personnel is ejected from the game for a violation of the playing rules, that individual must vacate the Players’ Bench area and may not, in any manner, further participate in the game. This includes directing the Team from the spectator area or by radio communications. Any violations shall be reported to the Proper Authorities. If the penalty to be imposed is a Minor Penalty and a goal is scored on the play by the non-offending side, the Minor Penalty shall not be imposed but Major Penalties shall be imposed in the normal manner regardless of whether or not a goal is scored. If two (2) or more Minor Penalties were to be imposed and a goal is scored on the play by the non-offending side, the Captain of the offending Team shall designate to the Referee which Minor Penalty(ies) will be assessed and which Minor Penalty will be washed out as a result of the scoring of the goal. When the penalty to be imposed is applicable under Rule 47 for “Head-butting”, Rule 58 “Butt-ending”, Rule 60 “High-sticking” or Rule 62 “Spearing”, and a goal is scored, two (2) minutes of the appropriate penalty will be assessed to the offending Player. This will be announced as a Double-minor Penalty for the appropriate infraction and the Player will serve two (2) minutes only. When a Team is “short-handed” by reason of one or more Minor or Bench Minor Penalties, and the Referee signals a further Minor Penalty or penalties against the “short-handed” Team and a goal is scored by the non-offending side before the whistle is blown, then the goal shall be allowed. The penalty or penalties signaled shall be assessed and the first of the Minor Penalties already being served shall automatically terminate under Rule 16 – Minor Penalties. Major Penalties shall be imposed in the normal manner regardless of whether or not a goal is scored. Should a Minor or Bench Minor Penalty be signaled against a Team already “short-handed” by reason of a Major Penalty, but before the play can be stopped to assess the Minor or Bench Minor Penalty, and a goal is scored by the non-offending side, the signaled Minor or Bench Minor Penalty shall not be imposed due to the scoring of the goal. Should a penalty be signaled against a Team already “short-handed” by reason of one or more Minor or Bench Minor Penalties, and the signaled penalty would result in the awarding of a “Penalty Shot”, but before the Referee can stop play to award the “Penalty Shot”, the non-offending Team scores a goal, then the signaled penalty (that would have resulted in a “Penalty Shot”) shall be assessed as a Minor (Double-minor or Major) Penalty and the first of the Minor Penalties already being served shall automatically terminate: (Rule 16 – Minor Penalties) When Players are penalized at a stoppage of play so as to result in one or more penalties being placed on the penalty time clock to one Team, the ensuing “face-off” shall be conducted at one of the two Face-off Spots in the offending Team’s End Zone. There are only three (3) exceptions to this application: (I) when a penalty is assessed after the scoring of a goal – “face-off” shall be conducted at Center ice; (II) when a penalty is assessed at the end (or start) of a period – “face-off” shall be conducted at Center ice; (III) when the defending Team is penalized, and the attacking Players enter the Attacking Zone beyond the outer edge of the End Zone Face-off Circle – “face-off” shall be conducted in the Neutral Zone. The Team awarded the “Power-Play” will have the choice of which End Zone spot the “face-off” will take place at to start the “Po­wer-Play”. When an infringement of a rule has been committed by Players of both Teams in the play resulting in the stoppage, the ensuing “face-off” will be conducted at the nearest Face-off Spot in that zone. (Rule 76 – FACE-OFF Locations)All “face-off” must be conducted on one of the nine (9) Face-off Spots located on the Rink. If two (2) rule violations are the reason for the stoppage of play (e.g.: “high-sticking the puck” and “intentional off-side”), the ensuing “face-off location” shall be determined as the spot that provides the least amount of “territorial advantage” to the offending Team. When the play is stopped for any reason not specifically attributable to either Team while the puck is in the Neutral Zone, the ensuing “face-off” shall be conducted at the nearest Face-off Spot outside the Blue Line whenever possible. When it is unclear as to which of the four (4) Face-off Spots is the nearest, the spot that gives the Home Team the greatest “territorial advantage” in the Neutral Zone will be selected for the ensuing “face-off”. When Players are penalized at a stoppage of play so as to result in penalties being placed on the penalty time clock to one Team, the ensuing “face-off” shall be conducted at one of the two (2) Face-off Spots in the offending Team’s Defending Zone. There are only three (3) exceptions to this application: (I) when a penalty is assessed after the scoring of a goal – “face-off” shall be conducted at Center ice; (II) when a penalty is assessed at the end (or start) of a period – “face-off” shall be conducted at Center ice; (III) or when the defending Team is penalized, and the attacking Players enter the Attacking Zone beyond the outer edge of the End Zone Face-off Circle – “face-off” shall be conducted in the Neutral Zone. The Team awarded the “Power-Play” will have the choice of which End Zone spot the “face-off” will take place at to start the “Power-Play”. When an infringement of a rule has been committed by Players of both Teams in the play resulting in the stoppage, the ensuing “face-off” will be conducted at the nearest Face-off Spot in that zone. When stoppage occurs between the end Face-off Spots and near end of the Rink, the puck shall be faced-off at the end Face-off Spot on the side where the stoppage occurs unless otherwise expressly provided by these rules. No “face-off” shall be made within 4.50 m of the goal or side Boards nor anywhere other than at a Face-off Spot. When a goal is illegally scored as a result of a puck being deflected directly off an Official, the resulting “face-off” shall be made at the nearest Face-off Spot in the zone where the puck deflected off of the Official. When a goal is illegally scored by the attacking Team by “directing”, “batting”, “kicking” or “high-sticking” the puck into the goal, the resulting “face-off” shall take place in the Neutral Zone at the nearest Face-off Spot. When the game is stopped for any reason not specifically covered in the official rules, the puck must be “faced-off” at a Face-off Spot in the zone nearest to where it was last played. Following a stoppage of play, should one or both defensemen who are the “point Players” or any Player coming from the Players’ Bench of the attacking Team, enter into the Attacking Zone beyond the outer edge of the End Zone Face-off Circle during an altercation, “gathering or scrum”, the ensuing “face-off” shall take place in the Neutral Zone near the Blue Line of the defending Team. This rule also applies when an “icing”, an “intentional off-side”, or a penalty has been assessed, and the ensuing “face-off” is to be in the offending Team’s Defending Zone. Should any of the non-offending Players enter the Attacking Zone beyond the outer edge of the End Zone Face-off Circle during an altercation, “gathering or scrum”, the ensuing “face-off” shall take place in the Neutral Zone near the Blue Line of the defending Team. For a violation of (Rule 71 – Premature Substitution) the resulting “face-off” will take place at the Center ice Face-off Spot when play is stopped beyond the Center red line. When play is stopped prior to the Center red line, the resulting “face-off” shall be conducted at the nearest Face-off Spot in the zone where the play was stopped. When play is stopped for an injured Player, the ensuing “face-off” shall be conducted at the Face-off Spot in the zone nearest the location of the puck when the play was stopped. When the injured Player’s Team has “control of the puck” in the Attacking Zone, the “face-off” shall be conducted at one of the Face-off Spots outside the Blue Line in the Neutral Zone. When the injured Player is in their Defending Zone and the attacking Team is in “control of the puck” in the Attacking Zone, the “face-off” shall be conducted at one of the defending Team’s end-zone Face-off Spots.Following an “icing”, the attacking Team will have the choice of which End Zone dot the “face-off” will take place. If, in the opinion of the Referee, the defending side intentionally abstains from playing the puck promptly when they are in a position to do so, they shall stop the play and order the resulting “face-off” on the adjacent corner Face-off Spot nearest the goal of the Team at fault. If the Linesperson shall have erred in calling an “icing the puck” infraction (regardless of whether either Team is “short-handed”), the puck shall be “faced-off” on the Center ice Face-off Spot.A Team that is in violation of this rule shall not be permitted to make any Player substitutions prior to the ensuing “face-off”. However, a Team shall be permitted to make a Player substitution to replace a Goalkeeper who had been substituted for an extra attacker, to replace an injured Player, a Player with a broken skate, or when a penalty has been assessed which affects the on-ice strength of either Team. The determination of Players on ice will be made when the puck leaves the offending Player’s stick.When Players are penalized at a stoppage of play so as to result in one or more penalties being placed on the penalty time clock to one Team, the ensuing “face-off” shall be conducted at one of the two Face-off Spots in the offending Team’s End Zone. There are only three (3) exceptions to this application: (I) when a penalty is assessed after the scoring of a goal – “face-off” shall be conducted at Center ice; (II) when a penalty is assessed at the end (or start) of a period – “face-off” shall be conducted at Center ice; (III) when the defending Team is penalized, and the attacking Players enter the Attacking Zone beyond the outer edge of the End Zone Face-off Circle – “face-off” shall be conducted in the Neutral Zone.

When an infringement of a rule has been committed by Players of both Teams in the play resulting in the stoppage, the ensuing “face-off” will be conducted at the nearest Face-off Spot in that zone.

Should any Player of a Team, equal or superior in “numerical strength” (power-play) to the opposing Team, shoot, bat or deflect the puck from their own half of the ice beyond the Goal Line of the opposing Team, play shall be stopped. For the purpose of deflected pucks, this only applies when the puck was originally propelled down the ice by the offending Team. For the purpose of this rule, the point of last contact with the puck by the Team in possession shall be used to determine whether icing has occurred or not. As such, the Team in possession must “gain the line” in order for the icing to be nullified. “Gaining the line” shall mean that the puck, while on the Player’s stick (not the Player’s skate) must make contact with the center red line in order to nullify a potential icing. For the purpose of interpretation of the rule, there are two judgments required for \"icing the puck\". The Linesperson must first determine that the puck will cross the Goal Line. Once the Linesperson determines that the puck will cross the Goal Line, “icing” is completed upon the determination as to which Player (attacking or defending) would first touch the puck. This decision by the Linesperson will be made by no later than the instant the first Player reaches the End Zone “face-off” dots with the Player's skate being the determining factor. Should the puck be shot down the ice in such a manner that it travels around the Boards and/or back towards the End Zone “face-off” dots, the same procedure shall be in effect in that the Linesperson shall determine within a similar distance as to who will have touched the puck first. For clarification, the determining factor is which Player would first touch the puck, not which Player would first reach the End Zone “face-off” dots. If the “race for the puck” is too close to determine by the time the first Player reaches the End Zone “face-off” dots, “icing” shall be called. The puck striking or deflecting off an Official does not automatically nullify a potential “icing”. If there is no “race” for the puck, icing will be not called until a defending skater crosses its defending blue line and the puck crosses the goal line (not between the goal posts).",

When a puck is struck with a “high stick” and subsequently comes into the “possession and control” of a Player from the offending Team (including the Player who made contact with the puck), either directly or deflected off any Player or official, there shall be a whistle. When a puck has been contacted by a “high stick”, the play shall be permitted to continue, provided that: (I) The puck has been batted to an opponent (when a Player bats the puck to an opponent, the Referee shall give the “washout” signal immediately – otherwise, they will stop the play). (II) A Player of the defending side shall bat the puck into their own goal in which case the goal shall be allowed. Cradling the puck on the blade of the stick (“lacrosse style”) above the normal height of the shoulders shall be prohibited and a stoppage of play shall result. If this is done by a Player on a “Penalty Shot” or Shootout attempt, the shot shall be stopped immediately and considered complete. (Rule 60 – High-sticking) When the play is stopped for the “high-sticking the puck” violation, the ensuing “face-off” must take place at the spot that provides the least amount of “territorial advantage” to the Team striking the puck, either where the puck was contacted illegally, or where it was last played by the offending Team. If the attacking Team is at fault and the play is stopped while the puck is in the Attacking Zone, the ensuing “face-off” must be moved to the nearest Face-off Spot in the Neutral Zone. When an attacking Player causes the puck to enter the opponent’s goal by contacting the puck above the height of the crossbar, either directly or deflected off any Player or official, the goal shall not be allowed. The determining factor is where the puck makes contact with the stick. If the puck makes contact with the stick at or below the level of the crossbar and enters the goal, this goal shall be allowed. A goal scored as a result of a defending Player striking the puck with their stick carried above the height of the crossbar of the goal frame into their own goal shall be allowed.A situation where an attacking Player (or Players) has (have) preceded the puck across the attacking Blue Line, but the defending Team is in a position to bring the puck back out of its Defending Zone without any delay or contact with an attacking Player or the attacking Players are in the process of clearing the Attacking Zone. If an “off-side” call is delayed, the Linesperson shall drop their arm to nullify the “off-side” violation and allow play to continue if: (I) All Players of the offending Team clear the zone at the same instant (skate contact with the Blue Line, \"3D\" judgement is not used in this situation) permitting the attacking Players to re-enter the Attacking Zone, or (II) the defending Team passes or carries the puck into the Neutral Zone. If, during the course of the “Delayed Off-side”, any member of the attacking Team touches the puck, attempts to “gain possession of a loose puck”, forces the defending puck carrier further back into their own zone, or who is about to make physical contact with the defending puck carrier, the Linesperson shall stop play for the “off-side” violation. If, during a “Delayed Off-side”, an attacking Player in the Attacking Zone elects to proceed to their Players’ Bench (which extends into the Attacking Zone) to be replaced by a Teammate, they shall be considered to have cleared the zone when both skates are off the ice and the Linesperson judges them to have left the playing surface. If their replacement comes onto the ice in the Attacking Zone, while the “Delayed Off-side” is still in effect, they too must clear the Attacking Zone. Once all attacking Players have cleared the Attacking Zone and the Linesperson have lowered their arm for the “Delayed Off-side”, all attacking Players may legally enter the Attacking Zone and pursue the puck.",

A warning shall be issued to the offending Team and the “face-off” must be conducted again. When two (2) “face-off” violations” have been committed by the same Team during the same “face-off”, this Team shall be penalized with a Bench Minor Penalty to the offending Team. This penalty shall be announced as a “Bench Minor Penalty for “Delay of Game” – Face-off Violation.” “Face-off” violations shall be summarized as follows (any of the four (4) On-ice Officials may identify a “face-off” violation): (I) Encroachment by any Player other than the center into the “face-off” area prior to the puck being dropped. Players on the perimeter of the Face-off Circle must keep both skates outside the Face-off Circle – skate contact with the line is permitted. If a Player's skate crosses the line into the Face-off Circle prior to the drop of the puck, this shall be deemed as a “face-off” violation. A Player's stick may be inside the Face-off Circle provided there is no physical contact with their opponent or their opponent's stick. (II) Encroachment by any Player into the area between the hash marks on the outer edges of the Face-off Circle prior to the puck being dropped. Players must also ensure that both of their skates do not cross their respective hash marks. Contact with the line with their skate is permitted. If a Player's skate crosses the line into the area between the hash marks prior to the drop of the puck, this shall be deemed as a “face-off” violation. A Player's stick may be inside the area between the hash marks provided there is no physical contact with their opponent or their opponent's stick. (III) Any physical contact with an opponent prior to the puck being dropped. If either Player taking the “face-off” makes helmet-to-helmet contact with their opponent, they must receive a first “face-off” violation warning. If the Linesperson cannot differentiate which Player initiated the contact, both Players must receive a first “face-off” violation warning. (IV) Failure by either center taking the “face-off” to “properly position themself behind the restraining lines” or place their stick on the ice – as outlined in Rule 76.4 – Face-off Procedure – Centers. \"Properly position themself behind the restraining lines\" shall mean that the center must place their feet on either side of the restraining lines that are parallel to the side Boards (contact with the lines is permissible), and the toe of the blade of their skates must not cross over the restraining lines that are perpendicular to the side Boards as they approach the Face-off Spot. The blade of the stick must then be placed on the ice, at least the toe of the blade of the stick, in the designated white area of the Face-off Spot and must remain there until the puck is dropped. (V) Failure to comply with this positioning and “face-off” procedure will result in a “face-off” violation. Whenever a Team has committed two (2) “face-off” violations during the same “face-off”, the Referee shall immediately assess the offending Team a Bench Minor Penalty for “Delay of Game”. This penalty shall be announced as a Bench Minor Penalty for Delay of Game – Face-off Violation. Players who are late to the “face-off” location and therefore in an off-side position for the ensuing “face-off” will be warned once in the game by the Referee. This warning will also be given to the offending Team’s Coach. In this situation, the offending Team’s center will not receive a warning for a “face-off” violation. Any subsequent violation shall result in a Bench Minor Penalty for “Delay of Game” being assessed to the offending Team. This penalty shall be announced as a “Bench Minor Penalty for “Delay of Game” – Slow Proceeding to Face-off Location. In the conduct of any “face-off” at any of the nine (9) Face-off Spots on the playing surface, no Player facing-off shall make any physical contact with their opponent’s body by means of their own body or by their stick except in the course of playing the puck after the “face-off” has been completed. For violation of this rule, the Referee may, at their discretion impose a Minor Penalty or penalties on the Player(s) whose action(s) caused the “physical contact”. Nonetheless, this “physical contact” prior to the dropping of the puck shall be deemed as a “face-off” violation and the center will be warned by the Linesperson that the Team has committed a “face-off” violation and any subsequent violation will result in a Bench Minor Penalty for “Delay of Game” – “face-off” violation being assessed. “Face-off” encroachment may be applied during “face-offs” at any of the nine (9) Face-off Spots on the playing surface However, since no such lines are painted on the ice at the four (4) Face-off Spots adjacent to the Blue Lines, Linespersons shall use their judgment as to whether or not a violation has occurred. All Players, other than the centers, shall be uniformly back from the “face-off” location similar to being outside the Face-off Circle for “face-offs” in the End Zones.Any loss of time on the game or penalty clocks due to a false “face-off” or a “face-off” violation must be replaced. The Video Review Consultant may be consulted to ensure the time is accurately replaced. (Rule 37.6 – Video Review to verify time on clock) The whistle will not be blown by the Official to start play. Playing time will commence from the instant the puck is “faced-off” and will stop when the whistle is blown, or a goal is scored.All “face-off” must be conducted on one of the nine (9) Face-off Spots located on the Rink. If two (2) rule violations are the reason for the stoppage of play (e.g.: “high-sticking the puck” and “intentional off-side”), the ensuing “face-off location” shall be determined as the spot that provides the least amount of “territorial advantage” to the offending Team. When the play is stopped for any reason not specifically attributable to either Team while the puck is in the Neutral Zone, the ensuing “face-off” shall be conducted at the nearest Face-off Spot outside the Blue Line whenever possible. When it is unclear as to which of the four (4) Face-off Spots is the nearest, the spot that gives the Home Team the greatest “territorial advantage” in the Neutral Zone will be selected for the ensuing “face-off”. When Players are penalized at a stoppage of play so as to result in penalties being placed on the penalty time clock to one Team, the ensuing “face-off” shall be conducted at one of the two (2) Face-off Spots in the offending Team’s Defending Zone. There are only three (3) exceptions to this application: (I) when a penalty is assessed after the scoring of a goal – “face-off” shall be conducted at Center ice; (II) when a penalty is assessed at the end (or start) of a period – “face-off” shall be conducted at Center ice; (III) or when the defending Team is penalized, and the attacking Players enter the Attacking Zone beyond the outer edge of the End Zone Face-off Circle – “face-off” shall be conducted in the Neutral Zone. The Team awarded the “Power-Play” will have the choice of which End Zone spot the “face-off” will take place at to start the “Power-Play”. When an infringement of a rule has been committed by Players of both Teams in the play resulting in the stoppage, the ensuing “face-off” will be conducted at the nearest Face-off Spot in that zone. When stoppage occurs between the end Face-off Spots and near end of the Rink, the puck shall be faced-off at the end Face-off Spot on the side where the stoppage occurs unless otherwise expressly provided by these rules. No “face-off” shall be made within 4.50 m of the goal or side Boards nor anywhere other than at a Face-off Spot. When a goal is illegally scored as a result of a puck being deflected directly off an Official, the resulting “face-off” shall be made at the nearest Face-off Spot in the zone where the puck deflected off of the Official. When a goal is illegally scored by the attacking Team by “directing”, “batting”, “kicking” or “high-sticking” the puck into the goal, the resulting “face-off” shall take place in the Neutral Zone at the nearest Face-off Spot. When the game is stopped for any reason not specifically covered in the official rules, the puck must be “faced-off” at a Face-off Spot in the zone nearest to where it was last played. Following a stoppage of play, should one or both defensemen who are the “point Players” or any Player coming from the Players’ Bench of the attacking Team, enter into the Attacking Zone beyond the outer edge of the End Zone Face-off Circle during an altercation, “gathering or scrum”, the ensuing “face-off” shall take place in the Neutral Zone near the Blue Line of the defending Team. This rule also applies when an “icing”, an “intentional off-side”, or a penalty has been assessed, and the ensuing “face-off” is to be in the offending Team’s Defending Zone. Should any of the non-offending Players enter the Attacking Zone beyond the outer edge of the End Zone Face-off Circle during an altercation, “gathering or scrum”, the ensuing “face-off” shall take place in the Neutral Zone near the Blue Line of the defending Team. For a violation of (Rule 71 – Premature Substitution) the resulting “face-off” will take place at the Center ice Face-off Spot when play is stopped beyond the Center red line. When play is stopped prior to the Center red line, the resulting “face-off” shall be conducted at the nearest Face-off Spot in the zone where the play was stopped. When play is stopped for an injured Player, the ensuing “face-off” shall be conducted at the Face-off Spot in the zone nearest the location of the puck when the play was stopped. When the injured Player’s Team has “control of the puck” in the Attacking Zone, the “face-off” shall be conducted at one of the Face-off Spots outside the Blue Line in the Neutral Zone. When the injured Player is in their Defending Zone and the attacking Team is in “control of the puck” in the Attacking Zone, the “face-off” shall be conducted at one of the defending Team’s end-zone Face-off Spots.Following the stoppage of play, the visiting Team shall promptly place a line-up on the ice ready for play and no substitution shall be made from that time until play has been resumed. The Home Team may then make any desired substitution, except in cases following an “icing”, which does not result in the delay of the game. “Placing a line-up on the ice” shall mean that both Teams shall place the full complement of Players (and not exceed) to which they are entitled within the line change time frame. If there is any undue delay by either Team in changing Players, the Referee shall order the offending Team or Teams to take their positions immediately and not permit any further Player changes. When a substitution has been made under the above rule, no additional substitution may be made until play commences. Once the line change procedure has been completed, no additional Player substitutions shall be permitted until the “face-off” has been completed legally and play has resumed, except when a penalty or penalties are imposed that affect the “on-ice strength” of either or both Teams. This may include penalties imposed following the completion of the line change and prior to the “face-off”, or due to a penalty assessed for a “face-off” violation – refer to Rule 82.2 – Line Change – Procedure. A Team that is in violation of (Rule 63.8 – Delaying the Game) or (Rule 81 – Icing) shall not be permitted to make any Player substitutions prior to the ensuing “face-off”. However, a Team shall be permitted to make a Player substitution to replace a Goalkeeper who had been substituted for an extra attacker, to replace an injured Player, or when a penalty has been assessed which affects the “on-ice strength” of either Team. The determination of Players on ice will be made when the puck leaves the offending Player’s stick. Goalkeepers’ substitution during a game will be conducted within the same time frame as a regular line change. No extra time will be allotted to the Goalkeeper coming off the bench, except in the case where an injury to a Goalkeeper occurs.",

If either Player taking the “face-off” makes helmet-to-helmet contact with their opponent, they must receive a first “face-off” violation warning. If the Linesperson cannot differentiate which Player initiated the contact, both Players must receive a first “face-off” violation warning. (IV) Failure by either center taking the “face-off” to “properly position themself behind the restraining lines” or place their stick on the ice – as outlined in Rule 76.4 – Face-off Procedure – Centers. \"Properly position themself behind the restraining lines\" shall mean that the center must place their feet on either side of the restraining lines that are parallel to the side Boards (contact with the lines is permissible), and the toe of the blade of their skates must not cross over the restraining lines that are perpendicular to the side Boards as they approach the Face-off Spot. The blade of the stick must then be placed on the ice, at least the toe of the blade of the stick, in the designated white area of the Face-off Spot and must remain there until the puck is dropped. (V) Failure to comply with this positioning and “face-off” procedure will result in a “face-off” violation. Whenever a Team has committed two (2) “face-off” violations during the same “face-off”, the Referee shall immediately assess the offending Team a Bench Minor Penalty for “Delay of Game”. This penalty shall be announced as a Bench Minor Penalty for Delay of Game – Face-off Violation. Players who are late to the “face-off” location and therefore in an off-side position for the ensuing “face-off” will be warned once in the game by the Referee. This warning will also be given to the offending Team’s Coach. In this situation, the offending Team’s center will not receive a warning for a “face-off” violation. Any subsequent violation shall result in a Bench Minor Penalty for “Delay of Game” being assessed to the offending Team. This penalty shall be announced as a “Bench Minor Penalty for “Delay of Game” – Slow Proceeding to Face-off Location. In the conduct of any “face-off” at any of the nine (9) Face-off Spots on the playing surface, no Player facing-off shall make any physical contact with their opponent’s body by means of their own body or by their stick except in the course of playing the puck after the “face-off” has been completed. For violation of this rule, the Referee may, at their discretion impose a Minor Penalty or penalties on the Player(s) whose action(s) caused the “physical contact”. Nonetheless, this “physical contact” prior to the dropping of the puck shall be deemed as a “face-off” violation and the center will be warned by the Linesperson that the Team has committed a “face-off” violation and any subsequent violation will result in a Bench Minor Penalty for “Delay of Game” – “face-off” violation being assessed. “Face-off” encroachment may be applied during “face-offs” at any of the nine (9) Face-off Spots on the playing surface However, since no such lines are painted on the ice at the four (4) Face-off Spots adjacent to the Blue Lines, Linespersons shall use their judgment as to whether or not a violation has occurred. All Players, other than the centers, shall be uniformly back from the “face-off” location similar to being outside the Face-off Circle for “face-offs” in the End Zones.Following a stoppage of play, the Referee will enforce the following line change procedure once they have determined that this procedure may begin: (I) The Referee shall give the visiting Team up to five (5) seconds to make its line change. (II) The Referee shall raise their hand to indicate no further changes by the visiting Team and to commence the Home Team’s line change. (III) The Referee shall give the Home Team up to eight (8) seconds to make its line change. (IV) The Referee shall lower their hand to indicate no further changes by the Home Team. (V) Any attempt by the either Team to make a change after the Referee’s signal, attempt to place too many Players on the ice for the subsequent line change, or attempt to make additional personnel changes, shall not be permitted and the Referee will send the Players who have attempted to change back to their Players’ Bench. The Referee will then issue a warning to the offending Team (through the Coach) indicating that any subsequent violations during the rest of the game (including Overtime), shall result in a Bench Minor Penalty for “delaying the game”. This penalty shall be announced as a “Bench Minor Penalty for “Delay of Game” – Improper Line Change.” (VI) The Linesperson conducting the “face-off” will blow their whistle (once the Referee has lowered their hand for the line changes) to indicate that all Players must be in position and on-side for the “face-off” within five (5) seconds. The “faceoff” will then be conducted (Rule 76 – Face-offs) (VII) Players who are slow (after the five-second warning whistle given by the Linesperson) getting to the “face-off” location or who are in an off-side position for the ensuing “face-off” will be warned once in the game by the Referee. This warning will also be given to the offending Team’s Coach. In this situation, the offending Team’s center is not ejected from the “face-off”. Any subsequent violation shall result in a Bench Minor Penalty for “Delay of Game” being assessed to the offending Team. (VIII) In the last two (2) minutes of regulation time and any time in the Overtime period(s), points (vi) and (vii) above are not applicable. The Linesperson shall give the Teams a reasonable amount of time to set up for the ensuing “face-off” after points (i) through (v) above have been enforced.",

Should any Player of a Team, equal or superior in “numerical strength” (power-play) to the opposing Team, shoot, bat or deflect the puck from their own half of the ice beyond the Goal Line of the opposing Team, play shall be stopped. For the purpose of deflected pucks, this only applies when the puck was originally propelled down the ice by the offending Team. For the purpose of this rule, the point of last contact with the puck by the Team in possession shall be used to determine whether icing has occurred or not. As such, the Team in possession must “gain the line” in order for the icing to be nullified. “Gaining the line” shall mean that the puck, while on the Player’s stick (not the Player’s skate) must make contact with the center red line in order to nullify a potential icing. For the purpose of interpretation of the rule, there are two judgments required for \"icing the puck\". The Linesperson must first determine that the puck will cross the Goal Line. Once the Linesperson determines that the puck will cross the Goal Line, “icing” is completed upon the determination as to which Player (attacking or defending) would first touch the puck. This decision by the Linesperson will be made by no later than the instant the first Player reaches the End Zone “face-off” dots with the Player's skate being the determining factor. Should the puck be shot down the ice in such a manner that it travels around the Boards and/or back towards the End Zone “face-off” dots, the same procedure shall be in effect in that the Linesperson shall determine within a similar distance as to who will have touched the puck first. For clarification, the determining factor is which Player would first touch the puck, not which Player would first reach the End Zone “face-off” dots. If the “race for the puck” is too close to determine by the time the first Player reaches the End Zone “face-off” dots, “icing” shall be called. The puck striking or deflecting off an Official does not automatically nullify a potential “icing”. If there is no “race” for the puck, icing will be not called until a defending skater crosses its defending blue line and the puck crosses the goal line (not between the goal posts).A situation where an attacking Player (or Players) has (have) preceded the puck across the attacking Blue Line, but the defending Team is in a position to bring the puck back out of its Defending Zone without any delay or contact with an attacking Player or the attacking Players are in the process of clearing the Attacking Zone. If an “off-side” call is delayed, the Linesperson shall drop their arm to nullify the “off-side” violation and allow play to continue if: (I) All Players of the offending Team clear the zone at the same instant (skate contact with the Blue Line, \"3D\" judgement is not used in this situation) permitting the attacking Players to re-enter the Attacking Zone, or (II) the defending Team passes or carries the puck into the Neutral Zone. If, during the course of the “Delayed Off-side”, any member of the attacking Team touches the puck, attempts to “gain possession of a loose puck”, forces the defending puck carrier further back into their own zone, or who is about to make physical contact with the defending puck carrier, the Linesperson shall stop play for the “off-side” violation. If, during a “Delayed Off-side”, an attacking Player in the Attacking Zone elects to proceed to their Players’ Bench (which extends into the Attacking Zone) to be replaced by a Teammate, they shall be considered to have cleared the zone when both skates are off the ice and the Linesperson judges them to have left the playing surface. If their replacement comes onto the ice in the Attacking Zone, while the “Delayed Off-side” is still in effect, they too must clear the Attacking Zone. Once all attacking Players have cleared the Attacking Zone and the Linesperson have lowered their arm for the “Delayed Off-side”, all attacking Players may legally enter the Attacking Zone and pursue the puck.",

The position of the Player’s skates and not that of their stick shall be the determining factor in all instances in deciding an “off-side”. A Player is “off-side” when both skates are completely over the leading edge of the Blue Line involved in the play. A Player is on-side when either of their skates are in contact with the Blue Line, or on their “own side” of the line, at the instant the puck completely crosses the leading edge of the Blue Line. On their “own side” of the line shall be defined by a “plane” of the Blue Line which shall extend from the leading edge of the Blue Line upwards. If a Player’s skate has yet to “break the plane” prior to the puck completely crossing the leading edge, they are deemed to be “on-side” for the purpose of the “off-side” rule. If, during a delayed off-side, an attacking player in the attacking zone elects to proceed to his players’ bench (which extends into the attacking zone) to be replaced by a teammate, he shall be considered to have cleared the zone when both skates are off the ice and the Linesperson judges him to have left the playing surface. A Player controlling the puck who shall cross the line ahead of the puck shall not be considered “off-side,” provided they have “possession and control” of the puck prior to their skates crossing the leading edge of the Blue Line. It should be noted that while the position of the Player’s skates is what determines whether a Player is “off-side,” nevertheless the question of an “off-side” never arises until the puck has completely crossed the leading edge of the Blue Line at which time the decision is to be made. If a Player legally carries, passes, or plays the puck back into their own Defending Zone while a Player of the opposing Team is in such Defending Zone, the “off-side” shall be ignored, and play permitted to continue.For violation of this rule, the play is stopped and the puck shall be “faced-off” in the Neutral Zone at the Face-off Spot nearest the Attacking Zone of the offending Team when the violation occurs as a result of the attacking Team carrying the puck over the attacking Blue Line, or from the Face-off Spot in the zone closest to the point of origin of the shot or pass (even if deflected off an attacking or defending Player or an official). For every “Delayed Off-side” situation, including an “intentional off-side”, the Linesperson will raise their non-whistle arm. They will allow play to continue and, if a stoppage of play occurs, there will be four possible “face-off” locations: (I) If carried over the Blue Line – “face-off” outside the Blue Line. (II) If shot into the Attacking Zone (or errant pass) – nearest Face-off Spot in the zone from which the pass or shot originated that gives the offending Team the least amount of “territorial advantage” (even if deflected off an attacking or defending Player or an official). (III) If the defending Player is pressured or about to be checked by an attacking Player – nearest Face-off Spot in the zone from which the pass or shot originated that gives the offending Team the least amount of “territorial advantage” (even if deflected off an attacking or defending Player or an official). (IV) If deemed to be an “intentional off-side” – Face-off Spot in the offending Team’s End Zone. When the Linesperson signals a “Delayed Off-side” and a defending Player shoots the puck which goes over the Protection Glass and out of play, the ensuing “face-off” shall be conducted at one of the Defending Zone End Zone Face-off Spots and the defending Player would be assessed a Minor Penalty. (Rule 63 – Delaying the Game) When the Linesperson signals a “Delayed Off-side” and the original shot deflects off a defending Player and out of play, the ensuing “face-off” shall take place at the nearest Face-off Spot in the zone from where the puck was shot.

If two (2) rule violations are the reason for the stoppage of play (e.g.: “high-sticking the puck” and “intentional off-side”), the ensuing “face-off location” shall be determined as the spot that provides the least amount of “territorial advantage” to the offending Team. When the play is stopped for any reason not specifically attributable to either Team while the puck is in the Neutral Zone, the ensuing “face-off” shall be conducted at the nearest Face-off Spot outside the Blue Line whenever possible. When it is unclear as to which of the four (4) Face-off Spots is the nearest, the spot that gives the Home Team the greatest “territorial advantage” in the Neutral Zone will be selected for the ensuing “face-off”. When Players are penalized at a stoppage of play so as to result in penalties being placed on the penalty time clock to one Team, the ensuing “face-off” shall be conducted at one of the two (2) Face-off Spots in the offending Team’s Defending Zone. There are only three (3) exceptions to this application: (I) when a penalty is assessed after the scoring of a goal – “face-off” shall be conducted at Center ice; (II) when a penalty is assessed at the end (or start) of a period – “face-off” shall be conducted at Center ice; (III) or when the defending Team is penalized, and the attacking Players enter the Attacking Zone beyond the outer edge of the End Zone Face-off Circle – “face-off” shall be conducted in the Neutral Zone. The Team awarded the “Power-Play” will have the choice of which End Zone spot the “face-off” will take place at to start the “Power-Play”. When an infringement of a rule has been committed by Players of both Teams in the play resulting in the stoppage, the ensuing “face-off” will be conducted at the nearest Face-off Spot in that zone. When stoppage occurs between the end Face-off Spots and near end of the Rink, the puck shall be faced-off at the end Face-off Spot on the side where the stoppage occurs unless otherwise expressly provided by these rules. No “face-off” shall be made within 4.50 m of the goal or side Boards nor anywhere other than at a Face-off Spot. When a goal is illegally scored as a result of a puck being deflected directly off an Official, the resulting “face-off” shall be made at the nearest Face-off Spot in the zone where the puck deflected off of the Official. When a goal is illegally scored by the attacking Team by “directing”, “batting”, “kicking” or “high-sticking” the puck into the goal, the resulting “face-off” shall take place in the Neutral Zone at the nearest Face-off Spot. When the game is stopped for any reason not specifically covered in the official rules, the puck must be “faced-off” at a Face-off Spot in the zone nearest to where it was last played. Following a stoppage of play, should one or both defensemen who are the “point Players” or any Player coming from the Players’ Bench of the attacking Team, enter into the Attacking Zone beyond the outer edge of the End Zone Face-off Circle during an altercation, “gathering or scrum”, the ensuing “face-off” shall take place in the Neutral Zone near the Blue Line of the defending Team. This rule also applies when an “icing”, an “intentional off-side”, or a penalty has been assessed, and the ensuing “face-off” is to be in the offending Team’s Defending Zone. Should any of the non-offending Players enter the Attacking Zone beyond the outer edge of the End Zone Face-off Circle during an altercation, “gathering or scrum”, the ensuing “face-off” shall take place in the Neutral Zone near the Blue Line of the defending Team. For a violation of (Rule 71 – Premature Substitution) the resulting “face-off” will take place at the Center ice Face-off Spot when play is stopped beyond the Center red line. When play is stopped prior to the Center red line, the resulting “face-off” shall be conducted at the nearest Face-off Spot in the zone where the play was stopped. When play is stopped for an injured Player, the ensuing “face-off” shall be conducted at the Face-off Spot in the zone nearest the location of the puck when the play was stopped. When the injured Player’s Team has “control of the puck” in the Attacking Zone, the “face-off” shall be conducted at one of the Face-off Spots outside the Blue Line in the Neutral Zone. When the injured Player is in their Defending Zone and the attacking Team is in “control of the puck” in the Attacking Zone, the “face-off” shall be conducted at one of the defending Team’s end-zone Face-off Spots.For violation of this rule, the play is stopped and the puck shall be “faced-off” in the Neutral Zone at the Face-off Spot nearest the Attacking Zone of the offending Team when the violation occurs as a result of the attacking Team carrying the puck over the attacking Blue Line, or from the Face-off Spot in the zone closest to the point of origin of the shot or pass (even if deflected off an attacking or defending Player or an official). For every “Delayed Off-side” situation, including an “intentional off-side”, the Linesperson will raise their non-whistle arm.

(II) If shot into the Attacking Zone (or errant pass) – nearest Face-off Spot in the zone from which the pass or shot originated that gives the offending Team the least amount of “territorial advantage” (even if deflected off an attacking or defending Player or an official). (III) If the defending Player is pressured or about to be checked by an attacking Player – nearest Face-off Spot in the zone from which the pass or shot originated that gives the offending Team the least amount of “territorial advantage” (even if deflected off an attacking or defending Player or an official). (IV) If deemed to be an “intentional off-side” – Face-off Spot in the offending Team’s End Zone. When the Linesperson signals a “Delayed Off-side” and a defending Player shoots the puck which goes over the Protection Glass and out of play, the ensuing “face-off” shall be conducted at one of the Defending Zone End Zone Face-off Spots and the defending Player would be assessed a Minor Penalty. (Rule 63 – Delaying the Game) When the Linesperson signals a “Delayed Off-side” and the original shot deflects off a defending Player and out of play, the ensuing “face-off” shall take place at the nearest Face-off Spot in the zone from where the puck was shot.

There are only three (3) exceptions to this application: (I) when a penalty is assessed after the scoring of a goal – “face-off” shall be conducted at Center ice; (II) when a penalty is assessed at the end (or start) of a period – “face-off” shall be conducted at Center ice; (III) or when the defending Team is penalized, and the attacking Players enter the Attacking Zone beyond the outer edge of the End Zone Face-off Circle – “face-off” shall be conducted in the Neutral Zone. The Team awarded the “Power-Play” will have the choice of which End Zone spot the “face-off” will take place at to start the “Power-Play”. When an infringement of a rule has been committed by Players of both Teams in the play resulting in the stoppage, the ensuing “face-off” will be conducted at the nearest Face-off Spot in that zone. When stoppage occurs between the end Face-off Spots and near end of the Rink, the puck shall be faced-off at the end Face-off Spot on the side where the stoppage occurs unless otherwise expressly provided by these rules. No “face-off” shall be made within 4.50 m of the goal or side Boards nor anywhere other than at a Face-off Spot. When a goal is illegally scored as a result of a puck being deflected directly off an Official, the resulting “face-off” shall be made at the nearest Face-off Spot in the zone where the puck deflected off of the Official. When a goal is illegally scored by the attacking Team by “directing”, “batting”, “kicking” or “high-sticking” the puck into the goal, the resulting “face-off” shall take place in the Neutral Zone at the nearest Face-off Spot. When the game is stopped for any reason not specifically covered in the official rules, the puck must be “faced-off” at a Face-off Spot in the zone nearest to where it was last played. Following a stoppage of play, should one or both defensemen who are the “point Players” or any Player coming from the Players’ Bench of the attacking Team, enter into the Attacking Zone beyond the outer edge of the End Zone Face-off Circle during an altercation, “gathering or scrum”, the ensuing “face-off” shall take place in the Neutral Zone near the Blue Line of the defending Team. This rule also applies when an “icing”, an “intentional off-side”, or a penalty has been assessed, and the ensuing “face-off” is to be in the offending Team’s Defending Zone. Should any of the non-offending Players enter the Attacking Zone beyond the outer edge of the End Zone Face-off Circle during an altercation, “gathering or scrum”, the ensuing “face-off” shall take place in the Neutral Zone near the Blue Line of the defending Team. For a violation of (Rule 71 – Premature Substitution) the resulting “face-off” will take place at the Center ice Face-off Spot when play is stopped beyond the Center red line. When play is stopped prior to the Center red line, the resulting “face-off” shall be conducted at the nearest Face-off Spot in the zone where the play was stopped. When play is stopped for an injured Player, the ensuing “face-off” shall be conducted at the Face-off Spot in the zone nearest the location of the puck when the play was stopped. When the injured Player’s Team has “control of the puck” in the Attacking Zone, the “face-off” shall be conducted at one of the Face-off Spots outside the Blue Line in the Neutral Zone. When the injured Player is in their Defending Zone and the attacking Team is in “control of the puck” in the Attacking Zone, the “face-off” shall be conducted at one of the defending Team’s end-zone Face-off Spots.",

If a Player’s skate has yet to “break the plane” prior to the puck completely crossing the leading edge, they are deemed to be “on-side” for the purpose of the “off-side” rule. If, during a delayed off-side, an attacking player in the attacking zone elects to proceed to his players’ bench (which extends into the attacking zone) to be replaced by a teammate, he shall be considered to have cleared the zone when both skates are off the ice and the Linesperson judges him to have left the playing surface. A Player controlling the puck who shall cross the line ahead of the puck shall not be considered “off-side,” provided they have “possession and control” of the puck prior to their skates crossing the leading edge of the Blue Line. It should be noted that while the position of the Player’s skates is what determines whether a Player is “off-side,” nevertheless the question of an “off-side” never arises until the puck has completely crossed the leading edge of the Blue Line at which time the decision is to be made. If a Player legally carries, passes, or plays the puck back into their own Defending Zone while a Player of the opposing Team is in such Defending Zone, the “off-side” shall be ignored, and play permitted to continue.",

If no goal is scored in the Overtime period, then the IIHF Penalty Shot Shootout Procedure will apply. The following procedure will be utilized: (I) Shots will be taken at both ends of the ice surface. The fourteen (14) meter wide longitudinal center section of the Rink, between the Face-off Spots in the Neutral and End Zones, will be dryscraped by the ice-resurfacing machine prior to the Penalty Shot Shootout during the time required to organize the program accordingly. (II) The procedure will begin with five (5) different shooters from each Team taking alternate shots. The Skaters do not need to be named beforehand. Eligible to participate in the “Penalty Shot” Shootout will be all Players from both Teams listed on the Official Game Sheet except as specified in article 3 below. (III) Any Skater whose penalty had not been completed when the Overtime period ended is not eligible to be one of the Players selected to take the shots and must remain in the Penalty Box or in the Dressing Room. Also, Players serving penalties assessed during the “Penalty Shot” Shootout must remain in the Penalty Box or in the Dressing Room until the end of the procedure. (IV) The Referee will call the two Captains to the On-ice Officials’ Crease and flip a coin to determine which Team takes the first shot. The winner of the coin toss will have the choice whether their Team will shoot first or second. (V) The Goalkeepers shall defend the same goal as in the Overtime period and remain in the goal when their own team is taking a shot. (VI) The Goalkeepers from each Team may be changed after each shot. (VII) The shots will be taken in accordance with (Rule 24 – Penalty Shot) (VIII) The Players of both Teams will take the shots alternately until a decisive goal is scored. The remaining shots will not be taken. (IX) If the score is still tied after all shots are taken by each Team, the procedure shall continue with a “tiebreak shoot-out”, using the same or new Players. The Team that shot second in the first five Penalty Shot will start first in the “tie-break shots”. The game shall be finished as soon as a duel of two Players brings the decisive result. The same Player can be used for each shot by a Team in the “tie-break shoot-out”. (X) The Official Scorekeeper will record all shots taken, indicating the Players and goals scored. (XI) Only the decisive goal will count in the result of the game. It shall be credited to the Team that scored the goal and charged against the Team that was scored upon. (XII) If a Team declines to participate in the “Penalty Shot” Shootout, the game will be declared as a loss for that Team and the other Team will be awarded 3 points for a win. If a Player declines to take a shot it will be declared \"no score\" for their Team.If a Goalkeeper sustains an injury or becomes ill, they must be ready to resume play immediately or be replaced by a substitute Goalkeeper and no additional time shall be allowed for the purpose of enabling the injured or ill Goalkeeper to resume their position. No warm-up shall be permitted for a substitute Goalkeeper in any game. The substitute Goalkeeper shall be subject to the regular rules governing Goalkeepers and shall be entitled to the same privileges. When a substitution for the injured Goalkeeper has been made, the injured Goalkeeper is not allowed to resume the position until the next stoppage of play. For a violation of the rule, a Minor Penalty for “Delay of Game” shall be assessed. When play has been stopped by the Referee or Linesperson due to an injured Goalkeeper, such Goalkeeper must be substituted for only if they have to proceed to the Players’ Bench to receive medical attention. Where an injury has occurred to a Goalkeeper and there is a stoppage of play, a Team Doctor (or other Medical Personnel) may go onto the ice to attend to the injured Player without waiting for the Referee’s consent. If the Doctor or Medical Personnel has come onto the ice to attend to the Goalkeeper and there is no undue delay, the Goalkeeper may remain in the game. However, no additional time shall be permitted by the Referee for the purpose of enabling the injured Goalkeeper to resume their position (i.e., no warm-up).",

                    "context": "All “face-off” must be conducted on one of the nine (9) Face-off Spots located on the Rink. If two (2) rule violations are the reason for the stoppage of play (e.g.: “high-sticking the puck” and “intentional off-side”), the ensuing “face-off location” shall be determined as the spot that provides the least amount of “territorial advantage” to the offending Team. When the play is stopped for any reason not specifically attributable to either Team while the puck is in the Neutral Zone, the ensuing “face-off” shall be conducted at the nearest Face-off Spot outside the Blue Line whenever possible. When it is unclear as to which of the four (4) Face-off Spots is the nearest, the spot that gives the Home Team the greatest “territorial advantage” in the Neutral Zone will be selected for the ensuing “face-off”. When Players are penalized at a stoppage of play so as to result in penalties being placed on the penalty time clock to one Team, the ensuing “face-off” shall be conducted at one of the two (2) Face-off Spots in the offending Team’s Defending Zone. There are only three (3) exceptions to this application: (I) when a penalty is assessed after the scoring of a goal – “face-off” shall be conducted at Center ice; (II) when a penalty is assessed at the end (or start) of a period – “face-off” shall be conducted at Center ice; (III) or when the defending Team is penalized, and the attacking Players enter the Attacking Zone beyond the outer edge of the End Zone Face-off Circle – “face-off” shall be conducted in the Neutral Zone. The Team awarded the “Power-Play” will have the choice of which End Zone spot the “face-off” will take place at to start the “Power-Play”. When an infringement of a rule has been committed by Players of both Teams in the play resulting in the stoppage, the ensuing “face-off” will be conducted at the nearest Face-off Spot in that zone. When stoppage occurs between the end Face-off Spots and near end of the Rink, the puck shall be faced-off at the end Face-off Spot on the side where the stoppage occurs unless otherwise expressly provided by these rules. No “face-off” shall be made within 4.50 m of the goal or side Boards nor anywhere other than at a Face-off Spot. When a goal is illegally scored as a result of a puck being deflected directly off an Official, the resulting “face-off” shall be made at the nearest Face-off Spot in the zone where the puck deflected off of the Official. When a goal is illegally scored by the attacking Team by “directing”, “batting”, “kicking” or “high-sticking” the puck into the goal, the resulting “face-off” shall take place in the Neutral Zone at the nearest Face-off Spot. When the game is stopped for any reason not specifically covered in the official rules, the puck must be “faced-off” at a Face-off Spot in the zone nearest to where it was last played. Following a stoppage of play, should one or both defensemen who are the “point Players” or any Player coming from the Players’ Bench of the attacking Team, enter into the Attacking Zone beyond the outer edge of the End Zone Face-off Circle during an altercation, “gathering or scrum”, the ensuing “face-off” shall take place in the Neutral Zone near the Blue Line of the defending Team. This rule also applies when an “icing”, an “intentional off-side”, or a penalty has been assessed, and the ensuing “face-off” is to be in the offending Team’s Defending Zone. Should any of the non-offending Players enter the Attacking Zone beyond the outer edge of the End Zone Face-off Circle during an altercation, “gathering or scrum”, the ensuing “face-off” shall take place in the Neutral Zone near the Blue Line of the defending Team. For a violation of (Rule 71 – Premature Substitution) the resulting “face-off” will take place at the Center ice Face-off Spot when play is stopped beyond the Center red line. When play is stopped prior to the Center red line, the resulting “face-off” shall be conducted at the nearest Face-off Spot in the zone where the play was stopped. When play is stopped for an injured Player, the ensuing “face-off” shall be conducted at the Face-off Spot in the zone nearest the location of the puck when the play was stopped. When the injured Player’s Team has “control of the puck” in the Attacking Zone, the “face-off” shall be conducted at one of the Face-off Spots outside the Blue Line in the Neutral Zone. When the injured Player is in their Defending Zone and the attacking Team is in “control of the puck” in the Attacking Zone, the “face-off” shall be conducted at one of the defending Team’s end-zone Face-off Spots.When a puck goes outside the playing area at either end or either side of the Rink, strikes any obstacles above the playing surface other than the Boards or Protective Glass, causes the glass, lighting, timing device or the supports to break, it shall be “faced-off” at the nearest Face-off Spot in the zone from where it was shot or deflected out of play. Should the On-ice Officials rule that the shot or deflection that caused the puck to go out of play originated from the neutral or Defending Zones, the resulting “face-off” location shall be the nearest Face-off Spot closest to the origin of the shot or deflection that gives the offending Team the least amount of “territorial advantage”. If the puck comes to rest on top of the Boards surrounding the playing area, it shall be considered to be in play and may be played legally by hand or stick. When the puck goes outside the playing area directly off the “face-off”, regardless as to which Player may have last contacted the puck, the “face-off” shall remain in the same spot and no penalty will be assessed to either Team for delaying the game. When the puck is shot and it makes contact with the gloves or the body of a Player hanging over the Players’ Bench, or if the puck enters the Players’ Bench through an open bench door, the “face-off” shall take place at the nearest Face-off Spot in the zone from where the puck was shot, however, if the puck hits an opposing Player’s glove or body that is hanging over the opposing Team’s Players’ Bench or enters the opposing Team’s Players’ Bench through an open bench door, the “face-off” shall take place in the Neutral Zone adjacent to the opponent’s Players’ Bench. Should the puck strike the curved glass located at the end of either Players’ Bench, play shall be stopped when observed by any of the On-ice Officials. The ensuing “face-off” shall be determined as if the puck went outside the playing area. Should the puck strike the spectator netting at the ends and the corners of the arena, play shall be stopped, and the ensuing “faceoff” shall be determined as if the puck went outside the playing area. Players must not stop playing the game until they hear the whistle to do so.",

Should the On-ice Officials rule that the shot or deflection that caused the puck to go out of play originated from the neutral or Defending Zones, the resulting “face-off” location shall be the nearest Face-off Spot closest to the origin of the shot or deflection that gives the offending Team the least amount of “territorial advantage”. If the puck comes to rest on top of the Boards surrounding the playing area, it shall be considered to be in play and may be played legally by hand or stick. When the puck goes outside the playing area directly off the “face-off”, regardless as to which Player may have last contacted the puck, the “face-off” shall remain in the same spot and no penalty will be assessed to either Team for delaying the game. When the puck is shot and it makes contact with the gloves or the body of a Player hanging over the Players’ Bench, or if the puck enters the Players’ Bench through an open bench door, the “face-off” shall take place at the nearest Face-off Spot in the zone from where the puck was shot, however, if the puck hits an opposing Player’s glove or body that is hanging over the opposing Team’s Players’ Bench or enters the opposing Team’s Players’ Bench through an open bench door, the “face-off” shall take place in the Neutral Zone adjacent to the opponent’s Players’ Bench. Should the puck strike the curved glass located at the end of either Players’ Bench, play shall be stopped when observed by any of the On-ice Officials. The ensuing “face-off” shall be determined as if the puck went outside the playing area. Should the puck strike the spectator netting at the ends and the corners of the arena, play shall be stopped, and the ensuing “faceoff” shall be determined as if the puck went outside the playing area. Players must not stop playing the game until they hear the whistle to do so.A Minor Penalty for “Delay of Game” shall be assessed: (I) On any Player, including the Goalkeeper, who holds, “freezes” or plays the puck with their stick, skates or body in such a manner as to deliberately cause a stoppage of play. Regarding to a Goalkeeper, this rule applies outside of their Goal Crease area; (II) On any Player who deliberately shoots or bats (using their hand or stick) the puck outside the playing area (from anywhere on the ice surface) during the play or after a stoppage of play; (III) On any Player who shoots or bats (using their hand or stick) the puck directly (non-deflected) out of the playing surface from their Defending Zone, except where there is no Protective Glass. The determining factor shall be the position of the puck when it was shot or batted by the offending Player. If contact with the puck occurs while the puck is inside the Defending Zone, and subsequently goes out of play, the Minor Penalty shall be assessed. When the puck is shot over the Protective Glass surrounding the Players’ Bench, the penalty will be assessed. Note: When the puck is shot into the Players’ Bench, the penalty will not apply. When the puck goes out of the playing area directly off a “face-off”, no penalty shall be assessed; (IV) On any Player who delays the game by deliberately displacing a Goal Post from its normal position. The Referee shall stop play immediately when the offending Team gains “control” of the puck. Note: If a Player deliberately displaces a Goal Post from its normal position when an opponent has an imminent scoring opportunity on an open net, a goal may be awarded by the Referee (Rule 63.7 – Awarded Goal) (V) On a Player other than the Goalkeeper who deliberately falls on or gathers the puck into their body; Note: Any Player who drops to their knees to block a shot should not be penalized if the puck is shot under them or becomes lodged in their clothing or equipment but any use of the hands to make the puck unplayable should be penalized promptly; (VI) On a Goalkeeper who “races out” of their Goal Crease in an attempt to beat the attacking Player to the puck and instead of playing the puck jumps on the puck causing a stoppage of play; Note: If a Goalkeeper comes out of their Goal Crease to “cut down the angle” on a shot and after making the save covers the puck, this shall be legal. (VII) On a Goalkeeper who, when they are in their own Goal Crease, deliberately falls on or gathers the puck into their body or who holds or places the puck against any part of the goal in such a manner as to cause a stoppage of play unless they are actually being checked by an opponent; (VIII) On a Goalkeeper who plays the puck outside of the Designated Area behind the net. The determining factor shall be the position of the puck. Note: The Minor Penalty will not be assessed when a Goalkeeper plays the puck while maintaining skate contact with the Goal Crease. (IX) For adjustments to clothing, equipment, skates, or sticks. Note: No penalty should be assessed when a water bottle is delivered to a Goalkeeper, however, this should be conducted during time-outs and if, in the opinion of the Referee, it is being done to intentionally delay the game, a Minor Penalty may be assessed. (X) No delay shall be permitted for the repair or adjustment of Goalkeeper’s equipment. If adjustments are required, the Goalkeeper shall leave the ice and their place shall be taken by the substitute Goalkeeper immediately.

When the puck is shot and it makes contact with the gloves or the body of a Player hanging over the Players’ Bench, or if the puck enters the Players’ Bench through an open bench door, the “face-off” shall take place at the nearest Face-off Spot in the zone from where the puck was shot, however, if the puck hits an opposing Player’s glove or body that is hanging over the opposing Team’s Players’ Bench or enters the opposing Team’s Players’ Bench through an open bench door, the “face-off” shall take place in the Neutral Zone adjacent to the opponent’s Players’ Bench. Should the puck strike the curved glass located at the end of either Players’ Bench, play shall be stopped when observed by any of the On-ice Officials. The ensuing “face-off” shall be determined as if the puck went outside the playing area. Should the puck strike the spectator netting at the ends and the corners of the arena, play shall be stopped, and the ensuing “faceoff” shall be determined as if the puck went outside the playing area. Players must not stop playing the game until they hear the whistle to do so.Should any Player cause the puck to go out of play or become “unplayable” in any zone, the “face-off” shall take place at the Face-off Spot in the zone from which the puck was shot. If deflected out of play, at the nearest Face-off Spot in the zone where it deflected out of play. If this stoppage is caused by an attacking player in the attacking zone, the face-off will take place at the closest face-off spot in the attacking zone (if the player did not make an infraction as per (Rule 63 – delaying the game)) If the zone happens to be the Neutral Zone, the Face-off Spot selected shall be the one that gives the offending Team the least amount of “territorial advantage”. For a puck that is “unplayable” due to being lodged in the netting or as a result of it being “frozen” between opposing Players, the resulting “face-off” shall be at either of the adjacent Face-off Spots or at the nearest Face-off Spot in the zone from which the puck was shot, unless otherwise covered in these rules. If the attacking Team shoots the puck into the zone and a “Delayed Off-side” is indicated, or if the attacking Team commits a game flow infraction such as contacting the puck with a “high-stick” or “batting the puck with a glove” (causing a stoppage of play), the ensuing “face-off” shall be in the Neutral Zone outside the offending Team’s Attacking Zone.",

Should the On-ice Officials rule that the shot or deflection that caused the puck to go out of play originated from the neutral or Defending Zones, the resulting “face-off” location shall be the nearest Face-off Spot closest to the origin of the shot or deflection that gives the offending Team the least amount of “territorial advantage”.

Players must not stop playing the game until they hear the whistle to do so.A Minor Penalty for “Delay of Game” shall be assessed: (I) On any Player, including the Goalkeeper, who holds, “freezes” or plays the puck with their stick, skates or body in such a manner as to deliberately cause a stoppage of play. Regarding to a Goalkeeper, this rule applies outside of their Goal Crease area; (II) On any Player who deliberately shoots or bats (using their hand or stick) the puck outside the playing area (from anywhere on the ice surface) during the play or after a stoppage of play; (III) On any Player who shoots or bats (using their hand or stick) the puck directly (non-deflected) out of the playing surface from their Defending Zone, except where there is no Protective Glass. The determining factor shall be the position of the puck when it was shot or batted by the offending Player. If contact with the puck occurs while the puck is inside the Defending Zone, and subsequently goes out of play, the Minor Penalty shall be assessed. When the puck is shot over the Protective Glass surrounding the Players’ Bench, the penalty will be assessed. Note: When the puck is shot into the Players’ Bench, the penalty will not apply. When the puck goes out of the playing area directly off a “face-off”, no penalty shall be assessed; (IV) On any Player who delays the game by deliberately displacing a Goal Post from its normal position. The Referee shall stop play immediately when the offending Team gains “control” of the puck. Note: If a Player deliberately displaces a Goal Post from its normal position when an opponent has an imminent scoring opportunity on an open net, a goal may be awarded by the Referee (Rule 63.7 – Awarded Goal) (V) On a Player other than the Goalkeeper who deliberately falls on or gathers the puck into their body; Note: Any Player who drops to their knees to block a shot should not be penalized if the puck is shot under them or becomes lodged in their clothing or equipment but any use of the hands to make the puck unplayable should be penalized promptly; (VI) On a Goalkeeper who “races out” of their Goal Crease in an attempt to beat the attacking Player to the puck and instead of playing the puck jumps on the puck causing a stoppage of play; Note: If a Goalkeeper comes out of their Goal Crease to “cut down the angle” on a shot and after making the save covers the puck, this shall be legal. (VII) On a Goalkeeper who, when they are in their own Goal Crease, deliberately falls on or gathers the puck into their body or who holds or places the puck against any part of the goal in such a manner as to cause a stoppage of play unless they are actually being checked by an opponent; (VIII) On a Goalkeeper who plays the puck outside of the Designated Area behind the net. The determining factor shall be the position of the puck. Note: The Minor Penalty will not be assessed when a Goalkeeper plays the puck while maintaining skate contact with the Goal Crease. (IX) For adjustments to clothing, equipment, skates, or sticks. Note: No penalty should be assessed when a water bottle is delivered to a Goalkeeper, however, this should be conducted during time-outs and if, in the opinion of the Referee, it is being done to intentionally delay the game, a Minor Penalty may be assessed. (X) No delay shall be permitted for the repair or adjustment of Goalkeeper’s equipment. If adjustments are required, the Goalkeeper shall leave the ice and their place shall be taken by the substitute Goalkeeper immediately. For an infraction of this rule by a Goalkeeper, a Minor Penalty shall be imposed.",

Should any Player of a Team, equal or superior in “numerical strength” (power-play) to the opposing Team, shoot, bat or deflect the puck from their own half of the ice beyond the Goal Line of the opposing Team, play shall be stopped. For the purpose of deflected pucks, this only applies when the puck was originally propelled down the ice by the offending Team. For the purpose of this rule, the point of last contact with the puck by the Team in possession shall be used to determine whether icing has occurred or not. As such, the Team in possession must “gain the line” in order for the icing to be nullified. “Gaining the line” shall mean that the puck, while on the Player’s stick (not the Player’s skate) must make contact with the center red line in order to nullify a potential icing. For the purpose of interpretation of the rule, there are two judgments required for \"icing the puck\". The Linesperson must first determine that the puck will cross the Goal Line. Once the Linesperson determines that the puck will cross the Goal Line, “icing” is completed upon the determination as to which Player (attacking or defending) would first touch the puck. This decision by the Linesperson will be made by no later than the instant the first Player reaches the End Zone “face-off” dots with the Player's skate being the determining factor. Should the puck be shot down the ice in such a manner that it travels around the Boards and/or back towards the End Zone “face-off” dots, the same procedure shall be in effect in that the Linesperson shall determine within a similar distance as to who will have touched the puck first. For clarification, the determining factor is which Player would first touch the puck, not which Player would first reach the End Zone “face-off” dots. If the “race for the puck” is too close to determine by the time the first Player reaches the End Zone “face-off” dots, “icing” shall be called. The puck striking or deflecting off an Official does not automatically nullify a potential “icing”. If there is no “race” for the puck, icing will be not called until a defending skater crosses its defending blue line and the puck crosses the goal line (not between the goal posts).Play shall not be stopped if the puck touches an On-ice Official anywhere on the Rink, regardless of whether a Team is “short-handed” or not. A puck that deflects back into the Defending Zone off an On-ice Official who is in the Neutral Zone, will be deemed to be “off-side”. (Rule 83 – Off-side) The puck striking or deflecting off an On-ice Official does not automatically nullify a “potential icing”. When a puck deflects off an On-ice Official and goes out of play, the ensuing “face-off” will take place at the Face-off Spot in the zone nearest to where the puck deflected off the Official. If a goal is scored as a result of being deflected directly into the net off an On-ice Official, the goal shall not be allowed.",

                    "context": "Each Team shall be permitted to take one thirty-second (30 s) “time-out” during the course of any game. All Players including Goalkeepers on the ice at the time of the “time-out” will be allowed to go to their respective benches. This “time-out” must be taken during a normal stoppage of play. Only one “time-out” (\"television commercial break / power break\" or Team “time-out”), shall be permitted at any one stoppage of play. For the purpose of this rule, a “television commercial break” is deemed an “official time-out” and not charged to either Team. Any Player designated by the Coach or the Coach will indicate to the Referee that their Team is exercising its option. The “time-out” must be requested by the team before the Referee has completed the players change procedure, before the Referee lowers his hand and points to the respecting face-off location. The Referee will report the “time-out” to the Game Timekeeper who shall be responsible for signaling the termination of the “time-out”. No “time-out” shall be granted following a “face-off” violation. No “time-out” shall be granted to the defensive Team following an icing, following the Goalkeeper causing a stoppage of play from a shoot-in from beyond the center red line, or when a defending Player accidentally dislodges the net causing a stoppage of play. No “time-out” shall be granted when a “Penalty Shot” has been awarded to either Team by the Referee, once instructions have been given to the Player taking the shot and the Goalkeeper defending the shot. No “time-out” will be granted during the shootout. No warm-up involving pucks on the ice shall be permitted for a Goalkeeper or replacement Goalkeeper during a “time-out”. If, after one warning, this continues, the Referee shall assess a “Delay of Game” penalty to the offending Team. During each regular period of the games in an IIHF Championship there shall be a maximum of three (3) commercial breaks, each with a maximum duration of seventy (70) seconds but can be subject to change for specific events. Commercial breaks shall be taken at the first stoppage of play after the following times on the game clock as it counts down: (I) Break number 1: 14.00 (min.) (II) Break number 2: 10.00 (min.) (III) Break number 3: 06.00 (min.) Despite the above indicated time slots, commercial breaks shall not be taken if: a) A goal is scored; b) A penalty shot is called; c) One of the Teams is playing short-handed; d) A fight breaks out on ice; e) An icing infraction is called; f) The net is dislodged accidentally by a defending player (incl. goalkeeper); and g) The puck is shot into the end zone from beyond the center red line and the goalkeeper freezes the puck resulting in a stoppage of play. Exceptions from point e-g above is when a penalty or penalties are assessed in the stoppage that affects the on-ice strength of either team. In the event that a commercial break is not taken during the time slot prescribed above, because of the exceptions above, the missed commercial opportunity shall be made up at the first stoppage of play in the next commercial break time slot. If there is another incident where the second commercial break is missed, this procedure shall continue to repeat itself until all commercial breaks are taken. However, there must always be at least 60 seconds between two commercial breaks. Any extra commercial break taken during a time slot shall follow the procedure described above and they shall be eliminated from the last remaining time slot of that period. They shall not be used to create extra commercial inventory for broadcasters. However, in such instances, the Commercial Coordinator will be instructed to turn on the light and signal the truck that an optional commercial opportunity is being taken. No commercial breaks shall be taken in the final thirty (30) seconds of the first and second periods, as well as during the final two (2) minutes of the third period. No commercial breaks shall be granted during overtime. The Teams shall comply with the following provisions during commercial breaks: a) Goalkeepers will be allowed to go to their respective players’ bench. b) Teams are allowed to change lines once the referee blows the whistle signaling the teams to return to the face-off with 20 seconds remaining in the commercial stoppage. c) These line changes will follow the same protocol as a normal line change during a stoppage of play. Immediately after a goal, there is a 45-second 'goal break'. This break is for the broadcaster to show replays of the goal and for the defending team to decide whether to initiate a coach's challenge (if Rule 38 is used in the game).",

                    "context": "The Video Review mechanism triggered by the Coach’s Challenge can only be utilized in “good goal / no goal” situations and is intended to be extremely narrow in scope. In all Coach’s Challenge situations, the original call on the ice will be overturned if, and only if, a conclusive and irrefutable determination can be made on the basis of video evidence that the original call on the ice was clearly not correct. If a review is not conclusive and/or there is any doubt whatsoever as to whether the call on the ice was correct, the original call on the ice will be confirmed. ( » For more information refer to IIHF Technology Codes & Regulations.) A Team may only request a Coach’s Challenge to review the following scenarios: (I) “Off-side”-Play Leading to a Goal A play that results in a “goal” call on the ice where the defending Team claims that the play should have been stopped by reason of an “Off-side” infraction by the attacking Team. (Rule 83 – Off-side) (II) Missed Game Stoppage Event in the Attacking Zone Leading to a Goal A play that results in a “goal” call on the ice where the defending Team claims that the play should have been stopped by reason of any play occurring in the Attacking Zone that should have resulted in a play stoppage caused by the attacking Team but did not. The one exception to this provision is when the puck is played out from the playing area by either team and goes unnoticed by the on-ice officials; (III) Scoring Plays Involving Potential “Interference on the Goalkeeper” Either: (1) A play that results in a “goal” call on the ice where the defending Team claims that the goal should have been disallowed due to “Interference on the Goalkeeper” (Rule 69 – Interference on the Goalkeeper;) or (2) A play that results in a “no goal” call on the ice despite the puck having entered the net, where the On-ice Officials have determined that the attacking Team was guilty of “Interference on the Goalkeeper” but where the attacking Team claims: • There was no actual contact of any kind initiated by an attacking Player with the Goalkeeper; • The attacking Player was pushed, shoved or fouled by a defending Player which caused the attacking Player to come into contact with the Goalkeeper; or • The attacking Player’s positioning within the Goal Crease did not impair the Goalkeeper’s ability to defend their goal and, in fact, had no discernable impact on the play. All Coach’s Challenges must be initiated by notice verbally communicated to a Referee prior to the Center ice “face-off” following a “goal” or, in the case of a “no goal” call by reason of “Interference on the Goalkeeper,” prior to the resumption of play. Teams may not unduly delay the resumption of play while evaluating whether or not to initiate a Coach’s Challenge. Any such delay or delay tactics may result in the denial of a right to Challenge and, at the discretion of the Referee, may also result in a Bench Minor Penalty for “Delaying the Game”. (Rule 63 – Delaying the Game) In order to expedite the review process, Coaches initiating a Coach’s Challenge are required to provide to the Referee, with reasonable specificity, both the reason for their Coach’s Challenge (i.e., the actual infraction that is being claimed) and the approximate time on the clock when the purported infraction transpired. Failure to provide this information with reasonable specificity may result in the denial of a right to a Coach’s Challenge. Only one Coach’s Challenge per Team per stoppage will be permitted. The IIHF Technology Department in cooperation with the Organizer will make available in all arenas suitable technology (for example, a handheld tablet or a television or computer monitor) that will allow the On-ice Officials, in conjunction with the Video Review Consultant, to review video replays of the play giving rise to the Coach’s Challenge. To the extent practical and possible, the replays made available to the On-ice Officials will be the same replays that are being utilized by the Video Review Consultant. Once a Coach’s Challenge has been initiated, the Video Review Consultant will immediately establish contact with the On-ice Official(s) responsible for the call (or non-call) on the ice via the headset and will inquire and discuss with the On-ice Official(s), prior to the On-ice Official reviewing any video, the following: (I) the On-ice Official’s “final call on the ice”; and (II) what the On-ice Official(s) observed on the play. The Video Review Consultant will be involved both in communicating with the On-ice Officials via the headset and with providing input to the On-ice Officials (Referees and Linespersons). The On-ice Officials are responsible for making the “final” decision. The “on-ice call” will then be reviewed simultaneously by the appropriate On-ice Official(s) at ice level and by the Video Review Consultant using any and all replays at their disposal. After their joint review and consultation, the On-ice Officials (Referees or Linespersons) will render the decision on whether to uphold or overturn the original “call on the ice”. Once a decision is made, the Referee will inform the Penalty Timekeeper/Public Address Announcer and will make the announcement on the ice. Teams may initiate a Coach’s Challenge on appropriate plays at any time during the game. In cases where a Challenge has been initiated for an “Off-side-Play Leading to a Goal” or a “Missed Game Stoppage Event in the Offensive Zone Leading to a Goal”, and a determination is made that the GOAL call on the ice should be overturned, the goal will be disallowed and the clock will be re-set to the time at which the play should have been stopped for the missed infraction. In such cases, a “face-off” will ensue in the ice location where it would have otherwise occurred had the on-ice infraction been called properly. If one or more penalties (Minor or Major) are assessed between the time of the missed infraction and the Video Review that disallows the apparent goal, the offending Team(s) (and responsible Player(s)) will still be required to serve the penalty(ies) identified and assessed, and the time of the penalty(ies) will be recorded as the time at which the play should have been stopped for the missed infraction. In cases where a Challenge has been initiated for a “goal” call on the ice where the defending Team claims that the goal should have been disallowed due to the “Interference on the Goalkeeper,” as described in (Rule 69 – Interference on the Goalkeeper) and a determination is made that the “call on the ice” should be overturned, the goal will be disallowed, and a “face-off” will ensue in the nearest Neutral Zone Face-off Spot outside the Attacking Zone. The Video Review process on these plays will be utilized exclusively for purposes of overturning a “goal” call on the ice – it will not be utilized for any other purpose, including, specifically, for assessing Minor or Major Penalties for Goalkeeper Interference. In cases where a Challenge has been initiated for a “no goal” call on the ice despite the puck having entered the net, where the On-ice Officials have determined that the attacking Team was guilty of “Interference on the Goalkeeper,” and a determination is made that the “call on the ice” should be overturned, the goal will be allowed an  a “face-off” will ensue at Center ice. (Rule 69 – Interference on the Goalkeeper) If a penalty for “Interference on a Goalkeeper” was indicated and based on the Video Review, no such action was committed by the attacking Player, no penalty shall be assessed for such an infraction. All other penalties not related to “Interference on a Goalkeeper” should be assessed and served in a normal manner. On the other hand, penalties not indicated cannot be assessed due to the Video Review. If a Team initiates a Coach’s Challenge for any of the enumerated scenarios in Rule 38.2 above and such Challenge does not result in the “final call on the ice” being overturned, the Team exercising such Challenge shall be assessed a Bench Minor Penalty (2 minutes) for Delaying the Game. If a Team that has already initiated one or more Coach’s Challenges that were unsuccessful, initiates a Coach’s Challenge for any of the enumerated scenarios in Rule 38.2 above and such Challenge does not result in the original call on the ice being overturned, the Team exercising such a Coach’s Challenge shall be assessed a Double-Bench Minor Penalty (4 minutes) for Delaying the Game. Note: If a situation cannot be reviewed by the on-ice officials due to a technical error (e.g. a \"black screen\"), the \"final call on the ice\" will stand. In this case, the Coach's Challenge will be considered “unsuccessful” but no Bench Minor Penalty will be assessed on the team that initiated the challenge The standard for overturning the call in the event of a “goal” call on the ice is that the On-ice Officials (Linespersons), after reviewing any and all available replays and consulting with the Video Review Consultant, determine that one or more Players on the attacking Team preceded the puck into the Attacking Zone prior to the goal being scored and that, as a result, the play should have been stopped for an “Off-side” infraction; where this standard is met, the goal will be disallowed. Goals will only be subject to review for a potential “Off-side” infraction if the puck does not come out of the Attacking Zone again between the time of the “Off-side” infraction and the time the goal is scored. The standard for overturning the call in the event of a “goal” call on the ice is that the On-ice Officials (Referees), after reviewing any and all available replays and consulting with the Video Review Consultant determine that the play should have been stopped for a event caused by the attacking team, but was not at some point after the puck entered the Attacking Zone but prior to the goal being scored; where this standard is met, the goal will be disallowed. Potential infractions that would require a play stoppage in the Attacking Zone by the attacking team, includes but may not be limited to: (Rule 79 – Hand Pass;) (Rule 80 – High-sticking the Puck; and) (Rule 85 – Puck Out of Bounds) . Such infractions will only serve as a basis for overturning a “goal” call on the ice if Video Review can conclusively establish that a game stoppage event had occurred in the Attacking Zone and was missed by the On-ice Official(s). Where the infraction at issue was a missed penalty call subject to the judgment or discretion of the On-ice Official(s), such infraction cannot result in the “goal” call on the ice being overturned, even if upon review, the On-ice Official(s) would have made a different call. Goals will only be reviewed for a potential “Missed Game Stoppage Event in the Attacking Zone” if the puck does not come out of the Attacking Zone again between the time of the “Missed Game Stoppage Event in the Attacking Zone” and the time the goal is scored. The standard for overturning the call in the event of a “goal” call on the ice is that the On-ice Officials (Referees), after reviewing any and all replays and consulting with the Video Review Consultant, determine that the goal should have been disallowed due to “Interference on the Goalkeeper,” as described in (Rule 69 – – Interference on the Goalkeeper;) where this standard is met, the goal will be disallowed. The standard for overturning the call in the event of a “no goal” call on the ice is that the On-ice Officials (Referees), after reviewing any and all replays and consulting with the Video Review Consultant, determine that the goal on the ice should have been allowed because either: (I) There was no actual contact of any kind initiated by the attacking Player with the Goalkeeper; or (II) The attacking Player was pushed, shoved or fouled by the defending Player causing the attacking Player to come into contact with the Goalkeeper; or (III) The attacking Player’s positioning within the Goal Crease did not impair the Goalkeeper’s ability to defend their goal and, in fact, had no discernable impact on the play; where this standard is met, the goal will be allowed. Each Team shall be permitted to take one thirty-second (30 s) “time-out” during the course of any game. All Players including Goalkeepers on the ice at the time of the “time-out” will be allowed to go to their respective benches. This “time-out” must be taken during a normal stoppage of play. Only one “time-out” (\"television commercial break / power break\" or Team “time-out”), shall be permitted at any one stoppage of play. For the purpose of this rule, a “television commercial break” is deemed an “official time-out” and not charged to either Team. Any Player designated by the Coach or the Coach will indicate to the Referee that their Team is exercising its option. The “time-out” must be requested by the team before the Referee has completed the players change procedure, before the Referee lowers his hand and points to the respecting face-off location. The Referee will report the “time-out” to the Game Timekeeper who shall be responsible for signaling the termination of the “time-out”. No “time-out” shall be granted following a “face-off” violation. No “time-out” shall be granted to the defensive Team following an icing, following the Goalkeeper causing a stoppage of play from a shoot-in from beyond the center red line, or when a defending Player accidentally dislodges the net causing a stoppage of play. No “time-out” shall be granted when a “Penalty Shot” has been awarded to either Team by the Referee, once instructions have been given to the Player taking the shot and the Goalkeeper defending the shot. No “time-out” will be granted during the shootout. No warm-up involving pucks on the ice shall be permitted for a Goalkeeper or replacement Goalkeeper during a “time-out”. If, after one warning, this continues, the Referee shall assess a “Delay of Game” penalty to the offending Team. During each regular period of the games in an IIHF Championship there shall be a maximum of three (3) commercial breaks, each with a maximum duration of seventy (70) seconds but can be subject to change for specific events. Commercial breaks shall be taken at the first stoppage of play after the following times on the game clock as it counts down: (I) Break number 1: 14.00 (min.) (II) Break number 2: 10.00 (min.) (III) Break number 3: 06.00 (min.) Despite the above indicated time slots, commercial breaks shall not be taken if: a) A goal is scored; b) A penalty shot is called; c) One of the Teams is playing short-handed; d) A fight breaks out on ice; e) An icing infraction is called; f) The net is dislodged accidentally by a defending player (incl. goalkeeper); and g) The puck is shot into the end zone from beyond the center red line and the goalkeeper freezes the puck resulting in a stoppage of play. Exceptions from point e-g above is when a penalty or penalties are assessed in the stoppage that affects the on-ice strength of either team. In the event that a commercial break is not taken during the time slot prescribed above, because of the exceptions above, the missed commercial opportunity shall be made up at the first stoppage of play in the next commercial break time slot. If there is another incident where the second commercial break is missed, this procedure shall continue to repeat itself until all commercial breaks are taken. However, there must always be at least 60 seconds between two commercial breaks. Any extra commercial break taken during a time slot shall follow the procedure described above and they shall be eliminated from the last remaining time slot of that period. They shall not be used to create extra commercial inventory for broadcasters. However, in such instances, the Commercial Coordinator will be instructed to turn on the light and signal the truck that an optional commercial opportunity is being taken. No commercial breaks shall be taken in the final thirty (30) seconds of the first and second periods, as well as during the final two (2) minutes of the third period. No commercial breaks shall be granted during overtime. The Teams shall comply with the following provisions during commercial breaks: a) Goalkeepers will be allowed to go to their respective players’ bench. b) Teams are allowed to change lines once the referee blows the whistle signaling the teams to return to the face-off with 20 seconds remaining in the commercial stoppage. c) These line changes will follow the same protocol as a normal line change during a stoppage of play. Immediately after a goal, there is a 45-second 'goal break'. This break is for the broadcaster to show replays of the goal and for the defending team to decide whether to initiate a coach's challenge (if Rule 38 is used in the game).",
