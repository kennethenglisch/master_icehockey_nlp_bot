A Team shall be composed of twenty-two (22) Players. No more than twenty (20) Skaters and two (2) Goalkeepers shall be permitted. For the purposes of these playing rules, any reference to “Player” shall refer to both Skaters and Goalkeepers. Any reference to “Goalkeeper” shall mean that the section of the rule is specific to Goalkeepers. Prior to the start of each game, the Team Manager or Coach of each Team shall list on a “Line-up / Roster Sheet” the Players who are eligible to play in the game. For a Team to play a game, it must be able to put on the ice at least five (5) Skaters and one (1) Goalkeeper at the beginning of the game. Only eligible Players can be listed on the Roster Sheet and play in a Game. Players who are registered for a tournament or event but who are not listed on the Official Game Sheet can participate in the pre-game warm-up. The Coach must submit the “Line-up / Roster Sheet” to the Official Scorekeeper at least sixty (60) minutes prior to the start of the game. The Official Game Sheet with the listed names and numbers of all eligible Players must be handed to the On-ice Game Officials before the Game, and no change shall be permitted to the Official Game Sheet after the commencement of the Game. Prior to the Game, if an Official (on-ice or off-ice) notices that a Player is in uniform but has not been included on the Official Game Sheet, the Referee shall bring this to the attention of the offending Team so that the necessary correction can be made to the Official Game Sheet with no penalty assessed. At IIHF Championships, a representative from each Team must confirm the “Line-up / Roster Sheet” at least two (2) minutes prior to the start of the Game, and Players may be added or deleted up to the “opening face-off”. Game rules will not allow for a Team to have more than six (6) Players (one (1) Goalkeeper and five (5) Skaters) on the ice at any time during game action when the team is not penalized.

During the play, if an injured Player wishes to retire from the ice and be replaced by a substitute, they must do so at the Players’ Bench and not through any other exit leading from the Rink. This is not a legal Player change and therefore when a violation occurs, a Bench-minor Penalty shall be imposed. If a penalized Player has been injured, they may proceed to the Dressing Room without taking a seat in the Penalty Box. The penalized Team shall immediately put a substitute Player in the Penalty Box, who shall serve the penalty until the injured Player is able to return to the game. They would replace their Teammate in the Penalty Box at the next stoppage of play. For violation of this rule, a Bench Minor Penalty shall be imposed. Should the injured penalized Player who has been replaced in the Penalty Box return to their Players’ Bench prior to the expiration of their penalty, they shall not be eligible to play until their penalty has expired. This includes coincidental penalties when their substitute is still in the Penalty Box awaiting a stoppage in play. The injured Player must wait until their substitute has been released from the Penalty Box before they are eligible to play. If, however, there is a stoppage of play prior to the expiration of their penalty, they must then replace their Teammate in the Penalty Box and is then eligible to return once their penalty has expired. When a Player is injured so that they cannot continue play or go to their Players’ Bench, the play shall not be stopped until the injured Player’s Team has secured control of the puck. If the Player’s Team is in “control of the puck” at the time of injury, play shall be stopped immediately unless their Team is in a scoring position. In the case where it is obvious that a Player has sustained a serious injury, the Referee and/or Linesperson may stop the play immediately. Where an injury has occurred to a Player and there is a stoppage of play, a Team Doctor (or other Medical Personnel) may go onto the ice to attend to the injured Player without waiting for the Referee’s consent. When play has been stopped by the Referee or Linesperson due to an injured Player, or whenever an injured Player is attended to on the ice by the Coach or Medical Personnel, such Player must be substituted for immediately. This injured Player cannot return to the ice until play has resumed. When play is stopped for an injured Player, the ensuing “face-off” shall be conducted at the Face-off Spot in the zone nearest the location of the puck when the play was stopped. When the injured Player’s Team has control of the puck in the Attacking Zone, the “face-off” shall be conducted at the nearest Faceoff Spot in the Neutral Zone. When the injured Player is in their Defending Zone and the attacking Team is in “possession of the puck” in the Attacking Zone, the “face-off” shall be conducted at the nearest Face-off Spot in the defending Team’s zone. A player who lies on the ice either feigning an injury or refusing to get up off the ice will be issued a Minor Penalty.)",

Rule 51 – Roughing When a goalkeeper is hit on the face mask by a hard shot with the puck and the Referee believes the Goalkeeper is or may be dazed by that hard shot, the Referee may stop play for safety reasons, if there is no immediate scoring chance for the attacking Team. When a Goalkeeper has lost their helmet and/or face mask and their Team has control of the puck, play shall be stopped immediately to allow the Goalkeeper the opportunity to recollect their helmet and/or face mask. When the opposing Team has control of the puck, play shall only be stopped if there is no immediate and impending scoring opportunity. This stoppage of play must be made by the Referee. When play is stopped because the Goalkeeper has lost their helmet and/ or face mask, the ensuing “face-off” shall take place at one of the defending Team’s End Zone Face-off Spots. When a Goalkeeper deliberately removes their helmet and/or face mask to secure a stoppage of play, the Referee shall stop play as outlined above and assess the Goalkeeper a Minor Penalty for “Delay of Game”. Rule 63 – Delaying the Game If the Goalkeeper deliberately removes their helmet and/or face mask when the opposing Team is on a breakaway (where the criteria’s for a penalty shot is meet except for a foul from behind), or during the course of a “Penalty Shot” or shootout attempt, the Referee shall award a goal to the non-offending Team.)",

A Player using “Dangerous Equipment” will be sent off the ice by the Referee and their Team shall receive a warning from the Referee. After the Team has been warned, all Players on that Team wearing such equipment shall be penalized. Rule 12 – Illegal Equipment Dangerous Equipment includes wearing a visor in a way that may cause injury to an opponent, wearing non-approved equipment, using dangerous or illegal skates or stick, failing to wear equipment under the uniform (except gloves, helmet, and goalkeeper’s pads), and cutting the palm out of one or both gloves. The use of pads or protectors made of metal, or of any other material likely to cause injury to an opposing Player is prohibited. Referees have the authority to prohibit any equipment they feel may cause injury to any participant in the game. Failure to comply with the Referees’ instructions shall result in a Minor Penalty for “Delay of Game”. A mask or protector of a design approved by the IIHF may be worn by a Player who has sustained a facial injury. In the first instance, the injured Player shall be entitled to wear any protective device prescribed by the Team Doctor. If any opposing Team objects to the device, it may record its objection with the IIHF. In cases where a stick may have been modified and it is evident that the edges have not been beveled, the Referee shall deem the stick to be dangerous equipment and removed from the game until the edges can be beveled sufficiently. No penalty is to be assessed unless the Player returns to the ice with the unmodified stick, in which case they will be assessed a Minor Penalty. Rule 63 – Delaying the Game)",

(II) Allow the “Penalty Shot” to be re-taken if they do not score or it could not be determined if the puck would have entered the area normally occupied by the net.

Equally, if the Goalkeeper is legitimately outside the immediate vicinity of the Goal Crease for the purpose of proceeding to the Players’ Bench to be substituted for an extra attacker, and they subsequently become involved in an altercation, the Minor Penalty for leaving the crease would not be assessed. In addition, during stoppages of play in the game, they must not proceed to their Players’ Bench for the purpose of receiving a replacement stick or equipment or repairs thereto, or due to an injury, or to receive instructions, without first obtaining permission to do so from the Referee. Otherwise, they must be replaced by the substitute Goalkeeper immediately (without any delay) or be assessed a Bench Minor Penalty. Rule 63 – Delaying the Game)",

If there is a need to delay the resumption of the play following an apparent goal, the Off-Ice Official at ice level will be alerted to signal one of the Referees to delay the Center-ice “face-off” for a moment. Once the Video Review Consultant has reviewed the video and confirmed that the goal is valid, the Off-Ice Official at ice level should signal to the Referee to resume play. If an expanded review is required on any potential goal, the Video Review Consultant shall instruct that the in-arena horn be sounded and the Public Address Announcer will make an announcement that the “play is under review.” Once the play has been reviewed and deemed a goal, the goal will be announced in the normal manner. If the review reveals that the goal should be disallowed, the Referee shall announce the reason for the disallowed goal. When the Video Review Consultant observes an incident involving a potential goal that was undetected by the On-ice Officials, the Off-ice Official will contact the Referee at the first stoppage of play and inform them that a review of the play is in progress. When a video review is initiated, the Public Address Announcer will make an announcement that “the play is under review.” Should the Video Review Consultant be able to determine that a goal has been scored through the use of video replay, and play on the ice has nonetheless continued, the Video Review Consultant shall instruct that the in-arena horn be sounded to stop play immediately, and the goal will be awarded. Should the first stoppage of play following an apparent goal coincide with the end of a period, the On-ice Official(s) will instruct both Teams to remain at their respective Players’ Bench until the Video Review of the play can be completed. If the review reveals that the goal should be counted, the clock (including penalty time clocks, if applicable) shall be reset to the time the goal was scored. If the review reveals that no goal was scored, no adjustment to the time clock(s) will be made. Only one goal can be awarded at any stoppage of play. If  an  apparent goal was scored by Team A and is subsequently confirmed as a goal by Video Review,  any goal scored by Team B during the period of time between the apparent goal by Team A and the stoppage of play (Team B’s goal), the Team B goal will not be awarded. If the apparent goal by Team A is deemed to have entered the goal illegally (e.g., a “distinct kicking motion”), the goal will be disallowed. No goal will be awarded to Team B either in this circumstance since the play should have been stopped at the time of the apparent goal.

In such cases, a “face-off” will ensue in the ice location where it would have otherwise occurred had the on-ice infraction been called properly. If one or more penalties (Minor or Major) are assessed between the time of the missed infraction and the Video Review that disallows the apparent goal, the offending Team(s) (and responsible Player(s)) will still be required to serve the penalty(ies) identified and assessed, and the time of the penalty(ies) will be recorded as the time at which the play should have been stopped for the missed infraction. In cases where a Challenge has been initiated for a “goal” call on the ice where the defending Team claims that the goal should have been disallowed due to the “Interference on the Goalkeeper,” as described in Rule 69 – Interference on the Goalkeeper and a determination is made that the “call on the ice” should be overturned, the goal will be disallowed, and a “face-off” will ensue in the nearest Neutral Zone Face-off Spot outside the Attacking Zone. The Video Review process on these plays will be utilized exclusively for purposes of overturning a “goal” call on the ice – it will not be utilized for any other purpose, including, specifically, for assessing Minor or Major Penalties for Goalkeeper Interference. In cases where a Challenge has been initiated for a “no goal” call on the ice despite the puck having entered the net, where the On-ice Officials have determined that the attacking Team was guilty of “Interference on the Goalkeeper,” and a determination is made that the “call on the ice” should be overturned, the goal will be allowed an  a “face-off” will ensue at Center ice. Rule 69 – Interference on the Goalkeeper If a penalty for “Interference on a Goalkeeper” was indicated and based on the Video Review, no such action was committed by the attacking Player, no penalty shall be assessed for such an infraction. All other penalties not related to “Interference on a Goalkeeper” should be assessed and served in a normal manner.

A “late-hit” constitutes reckless endangerment of a Player who “no longer has control or possession of the puck”. Any Player who is in the process of “abandoning” or “losing control or possession of the puck” is subject to a bodycheck so long as the aggressor is in the immediate vicinity of the Skater with the puck. A strict standard on acts of interference must be adhered to in all areas of the Rink. Body Position: “Body position” shall be determined as the Player skating in front of or beside their opponent, traveling in the same direction. A Player who is behind an opponent, who does not have the puck, may not use their stick, body, or free hand in order to restrain their opponent, but must skate in order to gain or reestablish their “proper position” in order to make a check.

A Player may “block the path” of an opponent provided they are in front of their opponent and moving in the same direction. Moving laterally and without “establishing body position”, then making contact with the non-puck carrier is not permitted and will be penalized as “interference”. A Player is always entitled to use their “body position” to lengthen an opponent’s path to the puck, provided their stick is not utilized (to make themself “bigger” and therefore considerably lengthening the distance their opponent must travel to get where they are going); their “free hand” is not used, and they do not take advantage of their “body position” to deliver an otherwise illegal check. Possession of the Puck: The last Player to touch the puck, other than the Goalkeeper, shall be considered the Player in “possession”.

Illegal means are acts which allow a Player to “establish,  maintain or restore body position” other than by skating. Pick: A “pick” is the action of a Player who checks an opponent who is not in “possession” of the puck and is unaware of the impending check/hit. A Player who is aware of an impending hit, not deemed to be a legal “battle for the puck,” may not be interfered with by a Player delivering a “pick.” A Player delivering a “pick” is one who moves into an opponent’s path without initially having “body position”, thereby taking them “out of the play”. When this is done, an “interference” penalty shall be assessed. Free Hand: When a “free hand” is used to hold, pull, tug, grab or physically restrain an opponent from moving “freely”, this must be penalized as “holding”. The “free hand” may be used by a Player to “fend off” an opponent or their stick but may not be used to hold an opponent’s stick or body. Stick: A Player who does not have “body position” on their opponent, who uses their stick (either the blade or the shaft, including the butt-end of the shaft) to impede or prevent their opponent from moving “freely” on the ice shall be assessed a “hooking” penalty.

(VII) On a Goalkeeper who, when they are in their own Goal Crease, deliberately falls on or gathers the puck into their body or who holds or places the puck against any part of the goal in such a manner as to cause a stoppage of play unless they are actually being checked by an opponent; (VIII) On a Goalkeeper who plays the puck outside of the Designated Area behind the net. The determining factor shall be the position of the puck. Note: The Minor Penalty will not be assessed when a Goalkeeper plays the puck while maintaining skate contact with the Goal Crease.

This rule also applies when an “icing”, an “intentional off-side”, or a penalty has been assessed, and the ensuing “face-off” is to be in the offending Team’s Defending Zone. Should any of the non-offending Players enter the Attacking Zone beyond the outer edge of the End Zone Face-off Circle during an altercation, “gathering or scrum”, the ensuing “face-off” shall take place in the Neutral Zone near the Blue Line of the defending Team. For a violation of Rule 71 – Premature Substitution the resulting “face-off” will take place at the Center ice Face-off Spot when play is stopped beyond the Center red line. When play is stopped prior to the Center red line, the resulting “face-off” shall be conducted at the nearest Face-off Spot in the zone where the play was stopped. When play is stopped for an injured Player, the ensuing “face-off” shall be conducted at the Face-off Spot in the zone nearest the location of the puck when the play was stopped. When the injured Player’s Team has “control of the puck” in the Attacking Zone, the “face-off” shall be conducted at one of the Face-off Spots outside the Blue Line in the Neutral Zone.

The blade of the stick must then be placed on the ice, at least the toe of the blade of the stick, in the designated white area of the Face-off Spot and must remain there until the puck is dropped. (V) Failure to comply with this positioning and “face-off” procedure will result in a “face-off” violation. Whenever a Team has committed two (2) “face-off” violations during the same “face-off”, the Referee shall immediately assess the offending Team a Bench Minor Penalty for “Delay of Game”. This penalty shall be announced as a Bench Minor Penalty for Delay of Game – Face-off Violation. Players who are late to the “face-off” location and therefore in an off-side position for the ensuing “face-off” will be warned once in the game by the Referee. This warning will also be given to the offending Team’s Coach. In this situation, the offending Team’s center will not receive a warning for a “face-off” violation.

If a Player's skate crosses the line into the area between the hash marks prior to the drop of the puck, this shall be deemed as a “face-off” violation. A Player's stick may be inside the area between the hash marks provided there is no physical contact with their opponent or their opponent's stick. (III) Any physical contact with an opponent prior to the puck being dropped. If either Player taking the “face-off” makes helmet-to-helmet contact with their opponent, they must receive a first “face-off” violation warning. If the Linesperson cannot differentiate which Player initiated the contact, both Players must receive a first “face-off” violation warning. (IV) Failure by either center taking the “face-off” to “properly position themself behind the restraining lines” or place their stick on the ice – as outlined in Rule 76.4 – Face-off Procedure – Centers. \"Properly position themself behind the restraining lines\" shall mean that the center must place their feet on either side of the restraining lines that are parallel to the side Boards (contact with the lines is permissible), and the toe of the blade of their skates must not cross over the restraining lines that are perpendicular to the side Boards as they approach the Face-off Spot. The blade of the stick must then be placed on the ice, at least the toe of the blade of the stick, in the designated white area of the Face-off Spot and must remain there until the puck is dropped. (V) Failure to comply with this positioning and “face-off” procedure will result in a “face-off” violation. Whenever a Team has committed two (2) “face-off” violations during the same “face-off”, the Referee shall immediately assess the offending Team a Bench Minor Penalty for “Delay of Game”. This penalty shall be announced as a Bench Minor Penalty for Delay of Game – Face-off Violation. Players who are late to the “face-off” location and therefore in an off-side position for the ensuing “face-off” will be warned once in the game by the Referee. This warning will also be given to the offending Team’s Coach. In this situation, the offending Team’s center will not receive a warning for a “face-off” violation. Any subsequent violation shall result in a Bench Minor Penalty for “Delay of Game” being assessed to the offending Team. This penalty shall be announced as a “Bench Minor Penalty for “Delay of Game” – Slow Proceeding to Face-off Location. In the conduct of any “face-off” at any of the nine (9) Face-off Spots on the playing surface, no Player facing-off shall make any physical contact with their opponent’s body by means of their own body or by their stick except in the course of playing the puck after the “face-off” has been completed. For violation of this rule, the Referee may, at their discretion impose a Minor Penalty or penalties on the Player(s) whose action(s) caused the “physical contact”. Nonetheless, this “physical contact” prior to the dropping of the puck shall be deemed as a “face-off” violation and the center will be warned by the Linesperson that the Team has committed a “face-off” violation and any subsequent violation will result in a Bench Minor Penalty for “Delay of Game” – “face-off” violation being assessed. “Face-off” encroachment may be applied during “face-offs” at any of the nine (9) Face-off Spots on the playing surface However, since no such lines are painted on the ice at the four (4) Face-off Spots adjacent to the Blue Lines, Linespersons shall use their judgment as to whether or not a violation has occurred. All Players, other than the centers, shall be uniformly back from the “face-off” location similar to being outside the Face-off Circle for “face-offs” in the End Zones.)",

Any attempts to delay the game by stalling or otherwise unnecessary actions by either Team shall result in the assessment of a Bench Minor Penalty for “delaying the game”. This penalty shall be announced as a “Bench Minor Penalty for “Delay of Game” – Slow Proceeding to “Faceoff Location (or Slow Proceeding to Players’ Bench).” During the play, if a Player wishes to retire from the ice and be replaced by a substitute, they must do so at the Players’ Bench and not through any other exit leading from the Rink. This is not a legal Player change and therefore when a violation occurs, a Bench Minor Penalty shall be imposed.)",

For every “Delayed Off-side” situation, including an “intentional off-side”, the Linesperson will raise their non-whistle arm. They will allow play to continue and, if a stoppage of play occurs, there will be four possible “face-off” locations: (I) If carried over the Blue Line – “face-off” outside the Blue Line. (II) If shot into the Attacking Zone (or errant pass) – nearest Face-off Spot in the zone from which the pass or shot originated that gives the offending Team the least amount of “territorial advantage” (even if deflected off an attacking or defending Player or an official). (III) If the defending Player is pressured or about to be checked by an attacking Player – nearest Face-off Spot in the zone from which the pass or shot originated that gives the offending Team the least amount of “territorial advantage” (even if deflected off an attacking or defending Player or an official). (IV) If deemed to be an “intentional off-side” – Face-off Spot in the offending Team’s End Zone. When the Linesperson signals a “Delayed Off-side” and a defending Player shoots the puck which goes over the Protection Glass and out of play, the ensuing “face-off” shall be conducted at one of the Defending Zone End Zone Face-off Spots and the defending Player would be assessed a Minor Penalty. Rule 63 – Delaying the Game When the Linesperson signals a “Delayed Off-side” and the original shot deflects off a defending Player and out of play, the ensuing “face-off” shall take place at the nearest Face-off Spot in the zone from where the puck was shot. When the defending Team is about to be penalized in the Defending Zone and the Linesperson has a “Delayed Off-side” signaled against the attacking Team on the same play, the ensuing “face-off” shall be conducted at one of the Defending Zone End Zone Face-off Spots.)",

The following procedure will be utilized: (I) Shots will be taken at both ends of the ice surface. The fourteen (14) meter wide longitudinal center section of the Rink, between the Face-off Spots in the Neutral and End Zones, will be dryscraped by the ice-resurfacing machine prior to the Penalty Shot Shootout during the time required to organize the program accordingly. (II) The procedure will begin with five (5) different shooters from each Team taking alternate shots. The Skaters do not need to be named beforehand. Eligible to participate in the “Penalty Shot” Shootout will be all Players from both Teams listed on the Official Game Sheet except as specified in article 3 below. (III) Any Skater whose penalty had not been completed when the Overtime period ended is not eligible to be one of the Players selected to take the shots and must remain in the Penalty Box or in the Dressing Room. Also, Players serving penalties assessed during the “Penalty Shot” Shootout must remain in the Penalty Box or in the Dressing Room until the end of the procedure. (IV) The Referee will call the two Captains to the On-ice Officials’ Crease and flip a coin to determine which Team takes the first shot. The winner of the coin toss will have the choice whether their Team will shoot first or second. (V) The Goalkeepers shall defend the same goal as in the Overtime period and remain in the goal when their own team is taking a shot. (VI) The Goalkeepers from each Team may be changed after each shot. (VII) The shots will be taken in accordance with Rule 24 – Penalty Shot (VIII) The Players of both Teams will take the shots alternately until a decisive goal is scored. The remaining shots will not be taken. (IX) If the score is still tied after all shots are taken by each Team, the procedure shall continue with a “tiebreak shoot-out”, using the same or new Players. The Team that shot second in the first five Penalty Shot will start first in the “tie-break shots”. The game shall be finished as soon as a duel of two Players brings the decisive result. The same Player can be used for each shot by a Team in the “tie-break shoot-out”. (X) The Official Scorekeeper will record all shots taken, indicating the Players and goals scored. (XI) Only the decisive goal will count in the result of the game. It shall be credited to the Team that scored the goal and charged against the Team that was scored upon. (XII) If a Team declines to participate in the “Penalty Shot” Shootout, the game will be declared as a loss for that Team and the other Team will be awarded 3 points for a win. If a Player declines to take a shot it will be declared \"no score\" for their Team.)",
