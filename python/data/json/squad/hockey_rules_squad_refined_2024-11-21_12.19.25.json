Any reference to “Goalkeeper” shall mean that the section of the rule is specific to Goalkeepers. Prior to the start of each game, the Team Manager or Coach of each Team shall list on a “Line-up / Roster Sheet” the Players who are eligible to play in the game. For a Team to play a game, it must be able to put on the ice at least five (5) Skaters and one (1) Goalkeeper at the beginning of the game. Only eligible Players can be listed on the Roster Sheet and play in a Game. Players who are registered for a tournament or event but who are not listed on the Official Game Sheet can participate in the pre-game warm-up. The Coach must submit the “Line-up / Roster Sheet” to the Official Scorekeeper at least sixty (60) minutes prior to the start of the game. The Official Game Sheet with the listed names and numbers of all eligible Players must be handed to the On-ice Game Officials before the Game, and no change shall be permitted to the Official Game Sheet after the commencement of the Game. Prior to the Game, if an Official (on-ice or off-ice) notices that a Player is in uniform but has not been included on the Official Game Sheet, the Referee shall bring this to the attention of the offending Team so that the necessary correction can be made to the Official Game Sheet with no penalty assessed. At IIHF Championships, a representative from each Team must confirm the “Line-up / Roster Sheet” at least two (2) minutes prior to the start of the Game, and Players may be added or deleted up to the “opening face-off”. Game rules will not allow for a Team to have more than six (6) Players (one (1) Goalkeeper and five (5) Skaters) on the ice at any time during game action when the team is not penalized. (Rule 74 – Too Many Players on the Ice) A Team must put at least four (4) Players (one (1) Goalkeeper and three (3) Skaters) on the ice, if two (2) or more Players are penalized. A Team must put the required number of players on the ice to resume play. (Rule 66 – Forfeit of Game) ( » For more information refer to IIHF Sport Guideline and IIHF Event Codes.)",

During the play, if an injured Player wishes to retire from the ice and be replaced by a substitute, they must do so at the Players’ Bench and not through any other exit leading from the Rink. This is not a legal Player change and therefore when a violation occurs, a Bench-minor Penalty shall be imposed. If a penalized Player has been injured, they may proceed to the Dressing Room without taking a seat in the Penalty Box. The penalized Team shall immediately put a substitute Player in the Penalty Box, who shall serve the penalty until the injured Player is able to return to the game. They would replace their Teammate in the Penalty Box at the next stoppage of play. For violation of this rule, a Bench Minor Penalty shall be imposed. Should the injured penalized Player who has been replaced in the Penalty Box return to their Players’ Bench prior to the expiration of their penalty, they shall not be eligible to play until their penalty has expired. This includes coincidental penalties when their substitute is still in the Penalty Box awaiting a stoppage in play. The injured Player must wait until their substitute has been released from the Penalty Box before they are eligible to play. If, however, there is a stoppage of play prior to the expiration of their penalty, they must then replace their Teammate in the Penalty Box and is then eligible to return once their penalty has expired. When a Player is injured so that they cannot continue play or go to their Players’ Bench, the play shall not be stopped until the injured Player’s Team has secured control of the puck. If the Player’s Team is in “control of the puck” at the time of injury, play shall be stopped immediately unless their Team is in a scoring position. In the case where it is obvious that a Player has sustained a serious injury, the Referee and/or Linesperson may stop the play immediately. Where an injury has occurred to a Player and there is a stoppage of play, a Team Doctor (or other Medical Personnel) may go onto the ice to attend to the injured Player without waiting for the Referee’s consent. When play has been stopped by the Referee or Linesperson due to an injured Player, or whenever an injured Player is attended to on the ice by the Coach or Medical Personnel, such Player must be substituted for immediately. This injured Player cannot return to the ice until play has resumed. When play is stopped for an injured Player, the ensuing “face-off” shall be conducted at the Face-off Spot in the zone nearest the location of the puck when the play was stopped. When the injured Player’s Team has control of the puck in the Attacking Zone, the “face-off” shall be conducted at the nearest Faceoff Spot in the Neutral Zone. When the injured Player is in their Defending Zone and the attacking Team is in “possession of the puck” in the Attacking Zone, the “face-off” shall be conducted at the nearest Face-off Spot in the defending Team’s zone. A player who lies on the ice either feigning an injury or refusing to get up off the ice will be issued a Minor Penalty.",

The helmet should be attached in such a way that it cannot fall off. If it falls off and has not been removed by an opponent Player, it has not been attached correctly. A Player on the ice whose helmet comes off during play has to exit the playing surface immediately. A player on the ice whose helmet comes off during play is not allowed to retrieve and put their helmet back on their head – for this they have to proceed to their Players’ Bench and exit the playing surface. If a Player does not comply with this rule, they shall be assessed a Minor Penalty without a warning (Rule 12 – Illegal Equipment) If the Player returns to their Players’ Bench to be substituted for, they may only return to the ice during play with a helmet (with the chin strap properly fastened). No Player may exit the Penalty Box during play without a helmet (with the chin strap properly fastened). Should they do so, the play shall be stopped once their Team has gained control of the puck and a Minor Penalty shall be assessed to the offending Player. If a Player’s chin strap becomes unfastened during game action, but the helmet stays on their head, they may continue to play until the next stoppage or until they leave the ice. A Player who intentionally removes an opponent’s helmet during play shall be assessed a Minor Penalty for “Roughing”. (Rule 51 – Roughing) When a goalkeeper is hit on the face mask by a hard shot with the puck and the Referee believes the Goalkeeper is or may be dazed by that hard shot, the Referee may stop play for safety reasons, if there is no immediate scoring chance for the attacking Team. When a Goalkeeper has lost their helmet and/or face mask and their Team has control of the puck, play shall be stopped immediately to allow the Goalkeeper the opportunity to recollect their helmet and/or face mask. When the opposing Team has control of the puck, play shall only be stopped if there is no immediate and impending scoring opportunity. This stoppage of play must be made by the Referee. When play is stopped because the Goalkeeper has lost their helmet and/ or face mask, the ensuing “face-off” shall take place at one of the defending Team’s End Zone Face-off Spots. When a Goalkeeper deliberately removes their helmet and/or face mask to secure a stoppage of play, the Referee shall stop play as outlined above and assess the Goalkeeper a Minor Penalty for “Delay of Game”. (Rule 63 – Delaying the Game) If the Goalkeeper deliberately removes their helmet and/or face mask when the opposing Team is on a breakaway (where the criteria’s for a penalty shot is meet except for a foul from behind), or during the course of a “Penalty Shot” or shootout attempt, the Referee shall award a goal to the non-offending Team.",

A Player using “Dangerous Equipment” will be sent off the ice by the Referee and their Team shall receive a warning from the Referee. After the Team has been warned, all Players on that Team wearing such equipment shall be penalized. (Rule 12 – Illegal Equipment) Dangerous Equipment includes wearing a visor in a way that may cause injury to an opponent, wearing non-approved equipment, using dangerous or illegal skates or stick, failing to wear equipment under the uniform (except gloves, helmet, and goalkeeper’s pads), and cutting the palm out of one or both gloves. The use of pads or protectors made of metal, or of any other material likely to cause injury to an opposing Player is prohibited. Referees have the authority to prohibit any equipment they feel may cause injury to any participant in the game. Failure to comply with the Referees’ instructions shall result in a Minor Penalty for “Delay of Game”. A mask or protector of a design approved by the IIHF may be worn by a Player who has sustained a facial injury. In the first instance, the injured Player shall be entitled to wear any protective device prescribed by the Team Doctor. If any opposing Team objects to the device, it may record its objection with the IIHF. In cases where a stick may have been modified and it is evident that the edges have not been beveled, the Referee shall deem the stick to be dangerous equipment and removed from the game until the edges can be beveled sufficiently. No penalty is to be assessed unless the Player returns to the ice with the unmodified stick, in which case they will be assessed a Minor Penalty. (Rule 63 – Delaying the Game)",

When a formal complaint is made by the Captain or Alternate Captain of a Team, against the dimensions of an opponent’s stick, that opponent must be on the ice at the time the request is made to the Referee. It must be specified which part of the stick should be measured. Once the request is made, and as long as the On-ice Officials maintain visual contact with the stick, it can be measured. This means that if the Player whose stick is about to be measured steps off the ice onto their Players’ Bench, their stick may still be measured provided the request was received prior to them leaving the ice surface and the stick remains in the view of at least one of the On-ice Officials. The Referee shall take the stick to the Penalty Box where the necessary measurement shall be made immediately. Players on both Teams shall retire to their respective Players Benches. To measure the curvature of the blade of the stick, the Referee must draw an imaginary line along the outside of the shaft to the bottom of the blade and then along the bottom of the blade – this will determine the location of the heel. Using an IIHF-approved measuring gauge, the Referee shall secure the gauge at the heel of the stick and measure the curvature of the blade from the heel to any point along the toe of the blade. To measure any other dimension of the stick, the Referee shall use a measuring tape. The result shall be reported to the Penalty Timekeeper, who shall record it on the Penalty Record form. The Referee will convey the result of the measurement to the Captain or Alternate Captain of the Team whose stick was measured. A Player whose stick has been measured and it is found not to conform to the rule shall be assessed a Minor Penalty and the stick will be returned to the Players’ Bench by the Referee. If the complaint is not sustained, a Bench Minor Penalty shall be imposed against the complaining Team. A Player who participates in the play (i.e., checks or prevents the movement of an opponent or who plays the puck) while carrying two sticks (including while taking a replacement stick to their Goalkeeper) shall incur a Minor Penalty under this rule. A request for a stick measurement in regular playing time is permitted, including after the scoring of a goal. However, a goal cannot be disallowed as a result of the measurement. A request for a stick measurement following a goal in Overtime (including one scored on a “Penalty Shot” in Overtime) is not permitted. Stick measurements prior to or during the shootout are permitted, subject to the guidelines outlined in (Rule 10.7. – Stick Measurement – Prior to Shootout Attempt) Any Player who deliberately breaks their stick or who refuses to surrender their stick for measurement when requested to do so by the Referee shall be assessed a Minor Penalty plus a ten-minute (10) Misconduct Penalty.",

If the “Penalty Shot” fails, the Referee shall permit the “Penalty Shot” to be taken over again. When an infraction worthy of a Minor Penalty is committed by the Goalkeeper during the “Penalty Shot” causing it to fail, no penalty is assessed but the Referee shall permit the “Penalty Shot” to be taken over again. Should a Goalkeeper commit a second (2nd) violation and the “Penalty Shot” fails, they shall be assessed a Misconduct Penalty and the Referee shall permit the “Penalty Shot” to be taken over again. A third (3rd) such violation shall result in the Goalkeeper being assessed a Game Misconduct Penalty and a goal shall be awarded. When a Major Penalty is committed by the Goalkeeper that causes the shot to fail, the Referee shall permit the “Penalty Shot” to be taken over again and the appropriate penalties shall be assessed to the Goalkeeper. The Goalkeeper may attempt to stop the “Penalty Shot” in any manner except by throwing their stick or any object, deliberately removes their helmet and/or face mask, or by deliberately dislodging the goal, in which case a goal shall be awarded. During the “Penalty Shot”, should the Goalkeeper, in an attempt at making a save, dislodge the goal accidentally, the Referee shall make one of the following determinations: (I) Award a goal if they deem the Player would have scored into the area normally occupied by the net had it not been dislodged. (II) Allow the “Penalty Shot” to be re-taken if they do not score or it could not be determined if the puck would have entered the area normally occupied by the net. (III) If the goal becomes dislodged after the puck has crossed the Goal Line thus ending the “Penalty Shot”, the above determinations do not apply, the “Penalty Shot” is complete. If, while a “Penalty Shot” is being taken, any Player, Coach or team personnel of the opposing Team interferes with or distracts the Player taking the “Penalty Shot” and, because of such action, the “Penalty Shot” fails, a second (2nd) attempt shall be permitted. The Referee shall impose a Bench Minor Penalty to the offending Team, and if a Player on the Bench is responsible, a Misconduct Penalty on the Player responsible shall be assessed. When a Coach or team personnel is guilty of such an act, a Game Misconduct Penalty shall be assessed on the responsible person and the matter will be reported to the Proper Authorities for possible further disciplinary action. If, while the “Penalty Shot” is being taken, any Player, Coach or team personnel of the Team taking the “Penalty Shot” interferes with or distracts the Goalkeeper defending the “Penalty Shot” and, because of such action, the shot is successful, the Referee shall rule no goal and shall impose a Bench Minor Penalty to the offending Team. If while the “Penalty Shot” is being taken a spectator throws any object onto the ice that in the judgment of the Referee interferes with the Player taking the “Penalty Shot” or the Goalkeeper defending the “Penalty Shot”, they shall permit the “Penalty Shot” to be taken again.

Nevertheless, the Referee shall not stop play until the attacking Team has “lost possession” of the puck to the defending Team. The intention of this rule is to restore a reasonable “scoring opportunity” which has been lost. If, however, the Player fouled is able to recover and obtain a “reasonable scoring opportunity” (or a Teammate is able to gain a reasonable scoring opportunity), no “Penalty Shot” should be awarded but the appropriate penalty should be signaled and assessed if a goal is not scored on the play. “Control of the puck” means the act of propelling the puck with the stick, hand, or feet. In order for a “Penalty Shot” to be awarded for a Player being fouled from behind, the following four (4) criteria must have been met: (I) The infraction must have taken place in the Neutral or Attacking Zone (i.e., over the puck carrier’s own Blue Line); (II) The infraction must have been committed from behind (except a foul committed from the front by the Goalkeeper on a “breakaway” situation); (III) The Player in “possession and control” (or, in the judgment of the Referee, the Player clearly would have “obtained possession and control” of the puck) must have been denied a reasonable chance to score. The fact that the Player got a shot off does not automatically eliminate this play from the “Penalty Shot” consideration criteria. If the infraction was from behind and the Player was denied a “more reasonable scoring opportunity” due to the infraction, then the “Penalty Shot” should still be awarded; (IV) The Player in “possession and control” (or, in the judgment of the Referee, the Player clearly would have “obtained possession and control”) must have had no opposing Player between themself and the Goalkeeper. If, in the opinion of the Referee, a Player makes contact with the puck first and subsequently trips the opponent in so doing, no “Penalty Shot” will be awarded, but a Minor Penalty for “tripping” shall be assessed. It should be noted that if the attacking Player manages to get around the Goalkeeper and has no defending Player between them and the “open goal”, and they are fouled from behind by the Goalkeeper or another defending Player, no goal can be awarded since the Goalkeeper is still on the ice.

If there are unusual delays for any reason, (e.g., altercation, arena installations, ice, or ice resurfacing problems) it is important to use discretion in starting the clock. To notify the teams that it is time to return to the ice surface at the beginning of each period, the official game timekeeper will sound a buzzer in the dressing room area to inform the teams using the following systems at each ice hall: a) Three (3) minutes remaining on the game clock-One (1) blast of the alarm by the official game timekeeper indicating that in one minute the teams will be called to the ice surface. b) Two (2) minutes remaining on the game clock-Two (2) blasts of the alarm by the official game timekeeper calling for the home team to immediately leave their dressing room and return to the ice surface. The away team immediately follows the last player of the home team to the ice surface. The Host has the option to propose amendments to this timing to ensure that the players are on the ice to start the period at the correct time.

The Penalty Timekeeper shall inform penalized Players and the Penalty Box Attendants as to the correct expiration time of all penalties. In the event of a malfunction of the Penalty Time Clock, the Game Clock shall be utilized to determine the expiration time of each penalty. Otherwise, the Penalty Time Clocks shall be the official timing device for all penalties that require a Team to play with less than five (5) Skaters. Players shall only be released from the Penalty Box when indicated by the Penalty Time Clock or as otherwise covered in the playing rules. The infraction of the rules for which each penalty has been imposed will be announced over the Public Address System as reported by the Referee. Where Players of both Teams are penalized at the same time, the penalty to the visiting Player will be announced first. In situations where multiple Game Misconduct Penalties have been assessed to any one (1) Player at the same stoppage of play, only one (1) Game Misconduct Penalty should be announced. Misconduct Penalties and coincident Major Penalties should not be recorded on the timing device (Penalty Time Clock) but such penalized Players should be alerted and released at the first stoppage of play following the expiration of their penalties. When a Player is assessed a Misconduct Penalty in addition to other penalties, the Misconduct Penalty shall only commence after all other penalties have been served (or washed out by the scoring of a goal). If a Player leaves the Penalty Box before the time has expired, the Penalty Timekeeper must note the time and notify the Referees at their first opportunity. It is the responsibility of the Penalty Timekeeper to ensure that penalized Players return to the Penalty Box before the puck is dropped for the start of a new period. In the event a penalized Player is not in the Penalty Box, the Penalty Timekeeper should notify the Referees and prevent the game from resuming until the Player is there.",

If there is a need to delay the resumption of the play following an apparent goal, the Off-Ice Official at ice level will be alerted to signal one of the Referees to delay the Center-ice “face-off” for a moment. Once the Video Review Consultant has reviewed the video and confirmed that the goal is valid, the Off-Ice Official at ice level should signal to the Referee to resume play. If an expanded review is required on any potential goal, the Video Review Consultant shall instruct that the in-arena horn be sounded and the Public Address Announcer will make an announcement that the “play is under review.” Once the play has been reviewed and deemed a goal, the goal will be announced in the normal manner. If the review reveals that the goal should be disallowed, the Referee shall announce the reason for the disallowed goal. When the Video Review Consultant observes an incident involving a potential goal that was undetected by the On-ice Officials, the Off-ice Official will contact the Referee at the first stoppage of play and inform them that a review of the play is in progress. When a video review is initiated, the Public Address Announcer will make an announcement that “the play is under review.” Should the Video Review Consultant be able to determine that a goal has been scored through the use of video replay, and play on the ice has nonetheless continued, the Video Review Consultant shall instruct that the in-arena horn be sounded to stop play immediately, and the goal will be awarded. Should the first stoppage of play following an apparent goal coincide with the end of a period, the On-ice Official(s) will instruct both Teams to remain at their respective Players’ Bench until the Video Review of the play can be completed. If the review reveals that the goal should be counted, the clock (including penalty time clocks, if applicable) shall be reset to the time the goal was scored. If the review reveals that no goal was scored, no adjustment to the time clock(s) will be made. Only one goal can be awarded at any stoppage of play. If  an  apparent goal was scored by Team A and is subsequently confirmed as a goal by Video Review,  any goal scored by Team B during the period of time between the apparent goal by Team A and the stoppage of play (Team B’s goal), the Team B goal will not be awarded. If the apparent goal by Team A is deemed to have entered the goal illegally (e.g., a “distinct kicking motion”), the goal will be disallowed. No goal will be awarded to Team B either in this circumstance since the play should have been stopped at the time of the apparent goal. The clock (including penalty time clocks, if applicable) shall be reset to the time of Team A’s apparent goal – whether awarded or disallowed. Any penalties signaled during the period of time between the apparent goal and the next stoppage of play shall be assessed in the normal manner, except when a Minor Penalty is to be assessed to the Team scored upon and is therefore nullified by the scoring of the goal – refer to (Rule 16.2. – Minor Penalties) (Rule 18.2. – Double-minor Penalties) If an infraction happens after the first stoppage of play following an apparent goal (infraction after the whistle) by either Team, it is assessed and served in the normal manner regardless as to the decision rendered by Video Review. When the Referee indicates there is a Video Review in progress, all Players (with the exception of the Goalkeepers) should proceed to their respective Players’ Bench immediately, and failure to do so may result in a Game Misconduct Penalty for offending Player(s) and shall be reported to the Proper Authorities. Any potential goal requiring Video Review must be reviewed prior to and/or during the next stoppage of play. No goal may be awarded (or disallowed) as a result of a Video Review once the play has resumed. The Video Review Consultant will connect directly with the Referee(s) at ice level to assist with the review of any close play or disputed goal. The On-ice Officials (Referees or Linespersons) decision shall be final. ( » For more information refer to IIHF Technology Codes & Regulations.)",

The responsibility is on the Player applying the check to ensure their opponent is not in a defenseless position and if so, they must avoid or minimize contact. However, in determining whether such contact could have been avoided, the circumstances of the check, including whether the opponent put themself in a vulnerable position immediately prior to or simultaneously with the check or whether the check was unavoidable can be considered. This balance must be considered by the Referees when applying this rule. Any unnecessary contact with a Player playing the puck on an obvious “icing” or “off-side” play which results in that Player hitting or impacting the Boards is “boarding” and must be penalized as such. In other instances where there is no contact with the Boards, it should be treated as “charging”.",

Charging shall mean the actions of a Player who either jumps to check an opponent, builds up speed by taking multiple strides immediately prior to making contact and / or travels an excessive distance with the sole purpose of delivering such a hit and / or violently checks an opponent in any manner. A “charge” may be the result of a check into the Boards, into the goal frame or in open ice. Any unnecessary contact with a Player playing the puck on an obvious “icing” or “off-side” play which results in that Player hitting or impacting the Boards is “boarding” and must be penalized as such. In other instances where there is no contact with the Boards, it should be treated as “charging.” This rule is superseded by all similar actions regarding an “illegal hit to the head”, except those related to “fighting”. A penalty shall be imposed on a Player who charges a Goalkeeper while the Goalkeeper is within their Goal Crease. A Goalkeeper is not “fair game” just because they are outside the Goal Crease area. The appropriate penalty should be assessed in every case where an opposing Player makes unnecessary contact with a Goalkeeper. However, incidental contact, at the discretion of the Referee, will be permitted when the Goalkeeper is in the act of playing the puck outside their Goal Crease, provided the attacking Player has made a reasonable effort to avoid such contact.",

Further Supplementary Discipline may be imposed. A “fight” shall be deemed to have occurred when at least one (1) Player punches or attempts to punch an opponent repeatedly or when two (2) Players wrestle in such a manner as to make it difficult for the Linespersons to intervene and separate the combatants. Any Player who persists in continuing or attempting to continue a “fight or altercation” after they have been ordered by the Referee to stop, or who resists a Linesperson in the discharge of their duties shall, at the discretion of the Referee, incur at least a Major Penalty (“Fighting”) plus an automatic Game Misconduct Penalty (5’+GMP) in addition to any additional penalties imposed. The Referees are provided very wide latitude in penalties they may impose under this rule. This is done intentionally to enable them to differentiate between the obvious degrees of responsibility of the participants either for starting the “fight or persisting in continuing the fight”. The discretion provided should be exercised rationally.

A hit resulting in contact with an opponent’s head where the head was the main point of contact and such contact to the head was avoidable is not permitted. This rule supersedes all similar actions regarding hits to the head and neck. When a Player is skating with their head up, whether they are in possession of the puck and may reasonably be expecting impending contact, an opponent does not have the right to hit them on the head or neck. A Player who delivers a bodycheck to an opponent who is skating with the puck with their head down in the direction of the Player and does not use an upward motion or drive their body up into the opponent, shall not be penalized for an “illegal check to the head”. A penalty for “Illegal check to the head or neck” will be assessed if one of the following occurs when a player checks an opponent: (I) A Player who directs a hit of any sort, with any part of their body or equipment, to the head or neck of an opposing Player or drives or forces the head of an opposing Player into the protective glass or boards using any part of their upper body. (II) A Player who extends and directs any part of their upper body to contact the head or neck of an opponent. (III) A Player who extends their body upward or outward in order to reach their opponent or uses any part of the upper body to contact an opponent’s head or neck. (IV) A Player who jumps (leaves their skates) to deliver a blow to the head or neck of an opponent. In determining whether contact with an opponent's head was avoidable, the circumstances of the hit including the following shall be considered: (V) Whether the Player attempted to hit squarely through the opponent’s body and the head was not \"picked\" as a result of poor timing, poor angle of approach, or unnecessary extension of the body upward or outward. If the primary force of a blow is initially to the body area and then contact slides up to the head or neck. (VI) Whether the opponent put themself in a vulnerable position by assuming a posture that made head contact on an otherwise full body check unavoidable. (VII) Whether the opponent materially changed the position of their body or head immediately prior to or simultaneously with the hit in a way that significantly contributed to the head contact.",

(II) A “kicked puck” that “deflects” off the stick of any Player (excluding the Goalkeeper’s stick) shall be ruled a “good goal”. (III) A goal will be allowed when an attacking Player “kicks” the puck, and the puck “deflects” off their own stick and then into the net. (IV) A goal will be allowed when a puck enters the goal after “deflecting” off an attacking Player’s skate or “deflects” off their skate while they are in the “process of stopping”. A goal cannot be scored by an attacking Player who “kicks” any equipment (stick, glove, helmet, etc.) at the puck, including “kicking” the blade of their own stick, causing the puck to cross the Goal Line.",

                    "context": "A Player who obstructs or prevents an opponent “without possession of the puck” from skating, receiving a pass, or moving about the ice freely is considered as “interference”. A “late-hit” constitutes reckless endangerment of a Player who “no longer has control or possession of the puck”. Any Player who is in the process of “abandoning” or “losing control or possession of the puck” is subject to a bodycheck so long as the aggressor is in the immediate vicinity of the Skater with the puck. A strict standard on acts of interference must be adhered to in all areas of the Rink. Body Position: “Body position” shall be determined as the Player skating in front of or beside their opponent, traveling in the same direction. A Player who is behind an opponent, who does not have the puck, may not use their stick, body, or free hand in order to restrain their opponent, but must skate in order to gain or reestablish their “proper position” in order to make a check. A Player is allowed the ice they are standing on (body position) and are not required to move in order to let an opponent proceed. A Player may “block the path” of an opponent provided they are in front of their opponent and moving in the same direction. Moving laterally and without “establishing body position”, then making contact with the non-puck carrier is not permitted and will be penalized as “interference”. A Player is always entitled to use their “body position” to lengthen an opponent’s path to the puck, provided their stick is not utilized (to make themself “bigger” and therefore considerably lengthening the distance their opponent must travel to get where they are going); their “free hand” is not used, and they do not take advantage of their “body position” to deliver an otherwise illegal check. Possession of the Puck: The last Player to touch the puck, other than the Goalkeeper, shall be considered the Player in “possession”. The Player deemed in “possession” of the puck may be checked legally, provided the check is rendered immediately following them “loss of control” and their opponent still finds themself within an “objectively reasonable window of opportunity” to deliver such a check refer to Rule 56.4 – Interference . Restrain: The actions of a Player who does not have “body position”, but instead uses illegal means (e.g., “hook” with stick; “hold” with hands, “trip” with the stick or in any manner) to impede an opponent who is not in “possession” of the puck. Illegal means are acts which allow a Player to “establish,  maintain or restore body position” other than by skating. Pick: A “pick” is the action of a Player who checks an opponent who is not in “possession” of the puck and is unaware of the impending check/hit. A Player who is aware of an impending hit, not deemed to be a legal “battle for the puck,” may not be interfered with by a Player delivering a “pick.” A Player delivering a “pick” is one who moves into an opponent’s path without initially having “body position”, thereby taking them “out of the play”. When this is done, an “interference” penalty shall be assessed. Free Hand: When a “free hand” is used to hold, pull, tug, grab or physically restrain an opponent from moving “freely”, this must be penalized as “holding”. The “free hand” may be used by a Player to “fend off” an opponent or their stick but may not be used to hold an opponent’s stick or body. Stick: A Player who does not have “body position” on their opponent, who uses their stick (either the blade or the shaft, including the butt-end of the shaft) to impede or prevent their opponent from moving “freely” on the ice shall be assessed a “hooking” penalty.

Regarding to a Goalkeeper, this rule applies outside of their Goal Crease area; (II) On any Player who deliberately shoots or bats (using their hand or stick) the puck outside the playing area (from anywhere on the ice surface) during the play or after a stoppage of play; (III) On any Player who shoots or bats (using their hand or stick) the puck directly (non-deflected) out of the playing surface from their Defending Zone, except where there is no Protective Glass. The determining factor shall be the position of the puck when it was shot or batted by the offending Player. If contact with the puck occurs while the puck is inside the Defending Zone, and subsequently goes out of play, the Minor Penalty shall be assessed. When the puck is shot over the Protective Glass surrounding the Players’ Bench, the penalty will be assessed. Note: When the puck is shot into the Players’ Bench, the penalty will not apply. When the puck goes out of the playing area directly off a “face-off”, no penalty shall be assessed; (IV) On any Player who delays the game by deliberately displacing a Goal Post from its normal position. The Referee shall stop play immediately when the offending Team gains “control” of the puck. Note: If a Player deliberately displaces a Goal Post from its normal position when an opponent has an imminent scoring opportunity on an open net, a goal may be awarded by the Referee (Rule 63.7 – Awarded Goal) (V) On a Player other than the Goalkeeper who deliberately falls on or gathers the puck into their body; Note: Any Player who drops to their knees to block a shot should not be penalized if the puck is shot under them or becomes lodged in their clothing or equipment but any use of the hands to make the puck unplayable should be penalized promptly; (VI) On a Goalkeeper who “races out” of their Goal Crease in an attempt to beat the attacking Player to the puck and instead of playing the puck jumps on the puck causing a stoppage of play; Note: If a Goalkeeper comes out of their Goal Crease to “cut down the angle” on a shot and after making the save covers the puck, this shall be legal. (VII) On a Goalkeeper who, when they are in their own Goal Crease, deliberately falls on or gathers the puck into their body or who holds or places the puck against any part of the goal in such a manner as to cause a stoppage of play unless they are actually being checked by an opponent; (VIII) On a Goalkeeper who plays the puck outside of the Designated Area behind the net. The determining factor shall be the position of the puck. Note: The Minor Penalty will not be assessed when a Goalkeeper plays the puck while maintaining skate contact with the Goal Crease. (IX) For adjustments to clothing, equipment, skates, or sticks. Note: No penalty should be assessed when a water bottle is delivered to a Goalkeeper, however, this should be conducted during time-outs and if, in the opinion of the Referee, it is being done to intentionally delay the game, a Minor Penalty may be assessed. (X) No delay shall be permitted for the repair or adjustment of Goalkeeper’s equipment. If adjustments are required, the Goalkeeper shall leave the ice and their place shall be taken by the substitute Goalkeeper immediately. For an infraction of this rule by a Goalkeeper, a Minor Penalty shall be imposed.",

In other words, goals scored while attacking Players are standing in the Goal Crease may, in appropriate circumstances be allowed. Goals should be disallowed only if: (I) an attacking Player, either by their positioning or by a \"relevant contact”, impairs the Goalkeeper’s ability to move freely within their Goal Crease or defend their goal; or (II) an attacking Player initiates intentional or deliberate contact with a Goalkeeper, inside or outside of their Goal Crease. “Incidental contact” with a Goalkeeper will be permitted, and resulting goals allowed, when such contact is initiated outside of the Goal Crease, provided the attacking Player has made a reasonable effort to avoid such contact. The rule will be enforced exclusively in accordance with the on-ice judgement of the Referee(s), but may be subject to a Video Review: (Rule 37 – Video Review) when applicable or to a Coach’s Challenge (Rule 38 – Coach’s Challenge) For purposes of this rule, “contact / relevant contact” whether \"incidental or otherwise\", shall mean any contact that is made between or among a Goalkeeper and attacking Player(s), whether by means of a stick or any part of the body. The overriding rationale of this rule is that a Goalkeeper should have the ability to move freely within their Goal Crease without being hindered by the actions of an attacking Player. If an attacking Player enters the Goal Crease and, by their actions, impairs the Goalkeeper’s ability to defend their goal, and a goal is scored, the goal will be disallowed. If an attacking Player is in the Goal Crease and does not leave immediately, the Referee has the possibility to stop the game and the subsequent “face-off” shall take place at the nearest Neutral Zone Face-off Spot outside the Attacking Zone of the offending Team. If an attacking Player has been pushed, shoved, or fouled by a defending Player so as to cause them to come into contact with the Goalkeeper, such contact will not be deemed contact initiated by the attacking Player for purposes of this rule, provided the attacking Player has made a reasonable effort to avoid such contact. If a defending Player has been pushed, shoved, or fouled by an attacking Player so as to cause the defending Player to come into contact with their own Goalkeeper, such contact shall be deemed contact initiated by the attacking Player for purposes of this rule, and if necessary, a penalty assessed to the attacking Player and if a goal is scored it would be disallowed.",

(Rule 74 – Too many Players on the Ice) A penalized Player who leaves the Penalty Box before their penalty has expired, whether play is in progress or not, shall incur an additional Minor Penalty after serving their unexpired penalty. Any Player who, having entered the Penalty Box, leaves the Penalty Box prior to the expiration of their penalty for the purpose of challenging an Official’s ruling, shall be assessed a Game Misconduct Penalty.

The Minor Penalty plus the unexpired time remaining in their original penalty must be served by a replacement Player placed in the Penalty Box by the Coach of the offending Team. If a Player leaves the Penalty Box before their penalty is fully served, the Penalty Timekeeper shall note the time and signal the On-ice Officials who will stop play when the offending Player’s Team obtains “control of the puck”. An additional Minor Penalty must be served by this Player in addition to the time remaining in their original penalty (this unexpired time is calculated from the time they left the Penalty Box illegally). In the case of a Player returning to the ice before their time has expired through an error of the Penalty Timekeeper, they are not to serve an additional penalty, but must serve their unexpired time this unexpired time is calculated from the time they left the Penalty Box through the error of the Penalty Timekeeper. At a stoppage of play following the expiration of their penalties, if a Player or Players exiting the Penalty Box get involved in an altercation, those coming from the Penalty Box shall be assessed the penalties they incur in the altercation. Should a Player coming from the Penalty Box at a stoppage of play get involved with an opponent and the opponent is deemed to be the instigator of the altercation, then the Player coming from the Penalty Box would not be subject to the Game Misconduct Penalty.

At the discretion of the On-ice Officials, should a substituting Player come onto the ice before their Teammate is within the 1.50 m limit of the Players’ Bench (and therefore clearly causing their Team to have “too many Players” on the ice), then a Bench Minor Penalty may be assessed. When a Player is retiring from the ice surface and is within the 1.50 m limit of their Players’ Bench, and their substitute is on the ice, then the retiring Player shall be considered off the ice for the purpose of Rule 70 – Leaving Players Bench or Penalty Box. If in the course of making a substitution, either the Player entering the game or the Player retiring from the ice surface plays the puck with their stick, skates or hands or who checks or makes any physical contact with an opposing Player while either the Player entering the game or the retiring Player is actually on the ice, then the infraction of “too many Players on the ice” will be called. If in the course of a substitution either the Player(s) entering the play or the Player(s) retiring is struck by the puck accidentally, the play will not be stopped, and no penalty will be called. During the play, the Player retiring from the ice must do so at the Players’ Bench and not through any other exit leading from the Rink. This is not a legal Player change and therefore when a violation occurs, a Bench Minor Penalty shall be imposed.

If two (2) rule violations are the reason for the stoppage of play (e.g.: “high-sticking the puck” and “intentional off-side”), the ensuing “face-off location” shall be determined as the spot that provides the least amount of “territorial advantage” to the offending Team. When the play is stopped for any reason not specifically attributable to either Team while the puck is in the Neutral Zone, the ensuing “face-off” shall be conducted at the nearest Face-off Spot outside the Blue Line whenever possible. When it is unclear as to which of the four (4) Face-off Spots is the nearest, the spot that gives the Home Team the greatest “territorial advantage” in the Neutral Zone will be selected for the ensuing “face-off”. When Players are penalized at a stoppage of play so as to result in penalties being placed on the penalty time clock to one Team, the ensuing “face-off” shall be conducted at one of the two (2) Face-off Spots in the offending Team’s Defending Zone. There are only three (3) exceptions to this application: (I) when a penalty is assessed after the scoring of a goal – “face-off” shall be conducted at Center ice; (II) when a penalty is assessed at the end (or start) of a period – “face-off” shall be conducted at Center ice; (III) or when the defending Team is penalized, and the attacking Players enter the Attacking Zone beyond the outer edge of the End Zone Face-off Circle – “face-off” shall be conducted in the Neutral Zone. The Team awarded the “Power-Play” will have the choice of which End Zone spot the “face-off” will take place at to start the “Power-Play”. When an infringement of a rule has been committed by Players of both Teams in the play resulting in the stoppage, the ensuing “face-off” will be conducted at the nearest Face-off Spot in that zone. When stoppage occurs between the end Face-off Spots and near end of the Rink, the puck shall be faced-off at the end Face-off Spot on the side where the stoppage occurs unless otherwise expressly provided by these rules. No “face-off” shall be made within 4.50 m of the goal or side Boards nor anywhere other than at a Face-off Spot. When a goal is illegally scored as a result of a puck being deflected directly off an Official, the resulting “face-off” shall be made at the nearest Face-off Spot in the zone where the puck deflected off of the Official. When a goal is illegally scored by the attacking Team by “directing”, “batting”, “kicking” or “high-sticking” the puck into the goal, the resulting “face-off” shall take place in the Neutral Zone at the nearest Face-off Spot. When the game is stopped for any reason not specifically covered in the official rules, the puck must be “faced-off” at a Face-off Spot in the zone nearest to where it was last played. Following a stoppage of play, should one or both defensemen who are the “point Players” or any Player coming from the Players’ Bench of the attacking Team, enter into the Attacking Zone beyond the outer edge of the End Zone Face-off Circle during an altercation, “gathering or scrum”, the ensuing “face-off” shall take place in the Neutral Zone near the Blue Line of the defending Team. This rule also applies when an “icing”, an “intentional off-side”, or a penalty has been assessed, and the ensuing “face-off” is to be in the offending Team’s Defending Zone. Should any of the non-offending Players enter the Attacking Zone beyond the outer edge of the End Zone Face-off Circle during an altercation, “gathering or scrum”, the ensuing “face-off” shall take place in the Neutral Zone near the Blue Line of the defending Team. For a violation of (Rule 71 – Premature Substitution) the resulting “face-off” will take place at the Center ice Face-off Spot when play is stopped beyond the Center red line. When play is stopped prior to the Center red line, the resulting “face-off” shall be conducted at the nearest Face-off Spot in the zone where the play was stopped. When play is stopped for an injured Player, the ensuing “face-off” shall be conducted at the Face-off Spot in the zone nearest the location of the puck when the play was stopped. When the injured Player’s Team has “control of the puck” in the Attacking Zone, the “face-off” shall be conducted at one of the Face-off Spots outside the Blue Line in the Neutral Zone. When the injured Player is in their Defending Zone and the attacking Team is in “control of the puck” in the Attacking Zone, the “face-off” shall be conducted at one of the defending Team’s end-zone Face-off Spots.",

When two (2) “face-off” violations” have been committed by the same Team during the same “face-off”, this Team shall be penalized with a Bench Minor Penalty to the offending Team. This penalty shall be announced as a “Bench Minor Penalty for “Delay of Game” – Face-off Violation.” “Face-off” violations shall be summarized as follows (any of the four (4) On-ice Officials may identify a “face-off” violation): (I) Encroachment by any Player other than the center into the “face-off” area prior to the puck being dropped. Players on the perimeter of the Face-off Circle must keep both skates outside the Face-off Circle – skate contact with the line is permitted. If a Player's skate crosses the line into the Face-off Circle prior to the drop of the puck, this shall be deemed as a “face-off” violation. A Player's stick may be inside the Face-off Circle provided there is no physical contact with their opponent or their opponent's stick. (II) Encroachment by any Player into the area between the hash marks on the outer edges of the Face-off Circle prior to the puck being dropped. Players must also ensure that both of their skates do not cross their respective hash marks. Contact with the line with their skate is permitted. If a Player's skate crosses the line into the area between the hash marks prior to the drop of the puck, this shall be deemed as a “face-off” violation. A Player's stick may be inside the area between the hash marks provided there is no physical contact with their opponent or their opponent's stick. (III) Any physical contact with an opponent prior to the puck being dropped. If either Player taking the “face-off” makes helmet-to-helmet contact with their opponent, they must receive a first “face-off” violation warning. If the Linesperson cannot differentiate which Player initiated the contact, both Players must receive a first “face-off” violation warning. (IV) Failure by either center taking the “face-off” to “properly position themself behind the restraining lines” or place their stick on the ice – as outlined in Rule 76.4 – Face-off Procedure – Centers. \"Properly position themself behind the restraining lines\" shall mean that the center must place their feet on either side of the restraining lines that are parallel to the side Boards (contact with the lines is permissible), and the toe of the blade of their skates must not cross over the restraining lines that are perpendicular to the side Boards as they approach the Face-off Spot. The blade of the stick must then be placed on the ice, at least the toe of the blade of the stick, in the designated white area of the Face-off Spot and must remain there until the puck is dropped. (V) Failure to comply with this positioning and “face-off” procedure will result in a “face-off” violation. Whenever a Team has committed two (2) “face-off” violations during the same “face-off”, the Referee shall immediately assess the offending Team a Bench Minor Penalty for “Delay of Game”. This penalty shall be announced as a Bench Minor Penalty for Delay of Game – Face-off Violation. Players who are late to the “face-off” location and therefore in an off-side position for the ensuing “face-off” will be warned once in the game by the Referee. This warning will also be given to the offending Team’s Coach. In this situation, the offending Team’s center will not receive a warning for a “face-off” violation. Any subsequent violation shall result in a Bench Minor Penalty for “Delay of Game” being assessed to the offending Team. This penalty shall be announced as a “Bench Minor Penalty for “Delay of Game” – Slow Proceeding to Face-off Location. In the conduct of any “face-off” at any of the nine (9) Face-off Spots on the playing surface, no Player facing-off shall make any physical contact with their opponent’s body by means of their own body or by their stick except in the course of playing the puck after the “face-off” has been completed. For violation of this rule, the Referee may, at their discretion impose a Minor Penalty or penalties on the Player(s) whose action(s) caused the “physical contact”. Nonetheless, this “physical contact” prior to the dropping of the puck shall be deemed as a “face-off” violation and the center will be warned by the Linesperson that the Team has committed a “face-off” violation and any subsequent violation will result in a Bench Minor Penalty for “Delay of Game” – “face-off” violation being assessed. “Face-off” encroachment may be applied during “face-offs” at any of the nine (9) Face-off Spots on the playing surface However, since no such lines are painted on the ice at the four (4) Face-off Spots adjacent to the Blue Lines, Linespersons shall use their judgment as to whether or not a violation has occurred. All Players, other than the centers, shall be uniformly back from the “face-off” location similar to being outside the Face-off Circle for “face-offs” in the End Zones.",

When this occurs, if it is deemed to be done deliberately, then the decision shall be NO GOAL. A goal cannot be scored when the puck has been deliberately batted with any part of the attacking Player’s body into the net (Rule 78.4 – Scoring a Goal) (II) When the puck has been kicked using a distinct kicking motion (Rule 49.2 – Kicking) (III) When the puck has deflected directly into the net off an official (Rule 85.4 – Puck Striking Official) (IV) When a goal has been scored and an ineligible Player is on the ice (Rule 68.5 – Disallowed Goal) (V) When an attacking Player has interfered with a Goalkeeper in their Goal Crease (Rule 69.1 – Interference on the Goalkeeper) (VI) When the puck has entered the net after making contact with an attacking Player’s stick that is above the height of the crossbar. Where the puck makes contact with the stick is the determining factor (Rule 80.3 – Disallowed Goal) (VII) When Video Review confirms the scoring of a goal at one end of the ice, any goal scored at the other end on the same play must be disallowed (Rule 37.2 – Video Review) (VIII) When a Linesperson reports a Double-minor Penalty for high-sticking or a Major Penalty to the Referee following the scoring of a goal by the offending Team, the goal must be disallowed, and the appropriate penalty assessed (Rule 32.4 – Reporting to Referee) (IX) When a Goalkeeper has been pushed into the net together with the puck after making a save (Rule 69.7 – Rebounds and Loose Pucks) (X) When the net becomes displaced accidentally. The goal frame is considered to be displaced if either or both goal pegs are no longer in their respective holes in the ice, or the net has come completely off one or both pegs, prior to or as the puck enters the goal. However, if this occurs as a result of the actions of a defending player, refer to (Rule 63.7 – Awarded Goal) (XI) During the delayed calling of a penalty, the offending Team cannot score unless the non-offending Team shoots the puck into their own net. This shall mean that a deflection off an offending Player or any physical action by an offending Player that may cause the puck to enter the non-offending Team’s goal, shall not be considered a legal goal. Play shall be stopped before the puck enters the net (whenever possible) and the signaled penalty assessed to the offending Team; (XII) When the Referee deems the play has been stopped, even if they have not physically had the opportunity to stop play by blowing their whistle; (XIII) Any goal scored, other than as covered by the official rules, shall not be allowed.",

Should any Player of a Team, equal or superior in “numerical strength” (power-play) to the opposing Team, shoot, bat or deflect the puck from their own half of the ice beyond the Goal Line of the opposing Team, play shall be stopped. For the purpose of deflected pucks, this only applies when the puck was originally propelled down the ice by the offending Team. For the purpose of this rule, the point of last contact with the puck by the Team in possession shall be used to determine whether icing has occurred or not. As such, the Team in possession must “gain the line” in order for the icing to be nullified. “Gaining the line” shall mean that the puck, while on the Player’s stick (not the Player’s skate) must make contact with the center red line in order to nullify a potential icing. For the purpose of interpretation of the rule, there are two judgments required for \"icing the puck\". The Linesperson must first determine that the puck will cross the Goal Line. Once the Linesperson determines that the puck will cross the Goal Line, “icing” is completed upon the determination as to which Player (attacking or defending) would first touch the puck. This decision by the Linesperson will be made by no later than the instant the first Player reaches the End Zone “face-off” dots with the Player's skate being the determining factor. Should the puck be shot down the ice in such a manner that it travels around the Boards and/or back towards the End Zone “face-off” dots, the same procedure shall be in effect in that the Linesperson shall determine within a similar distance as to who will have touched the puck first. For clarification, the determining factor is which Player would first touch the puck, not which Player would first reach the End Zone “face-off” dots. If the “race for the puck” is too close to determine by the time the first Player reaches the End Zone “face-off” dots, “icing” shall be called. The puck striking or deflecting off an Official does not automatically nullify a potential “icing”. If there is no “race” for the puck, icing will be not called until a defending skater crosses its defending blue line and the puck crosses the goal line (not between the goal posts).",

The position of the Player’s skates and not that of their stick shall be the determining factor in all instances in deciding an “off-side”. A Player is “off-side” when both skates are completely over the leading edge of the Blue Line involved in the play. A Player is on-side when either of their skates are in contact with the Blue Line, or on their “own side” of the line, at the instant the puck completely crosses the leading edge of the Blue Line. On their “own side” of the line shall be defined by a “plane” of the Blue Line which shall extend from the leading edge of the Blue Line upwards. If a Player’s skate has yet to “break the plane” prior to the puck completely crossing the leading edge, they are deemed to be “on-side” for the purpose of the “off-side” rule. If, during a delayed off-side, an attacking player in the attacking zone elects to proceed to his players’ bench (which extends into the attacking zone) to be replaced by a teammate, he shall be considered to have cleared the zone when both skates are off the ice and the Linesperson judges him to have left the playing surface. A Player controlling the puck who shall cross the line ahead of the puck shall not be considered “off-side,” provided they have “possession and control” of the puck prior to their skates crossing the leading edge of the Blue Line. It should be noted that while the position of the Player’s skates is what determines whether a Player is “off-side,” nevertheless the question of an “off-side” never arises until the puck has completely crossed the leading edge of the Blue Line at which time the decision is to be made. If a Player legally carries, passes, or plays the puck back into their own Defending Zone while a Player of the opposing Team is in such Defending Zone, the “off-side” shall be ignored, and play permitted to continue.",

For every “Delayed Off-side” situation, including an “intentional off-side”, the Linesperson will raise their non-whistle arm. They will allow play to continue and, if a stoppage of play occurs, there will be four possible “face-off” locations: (I) If carried over the Blue Line – “face-off” outside the Blue Line. (II) If shot into the Attacking Zone (or errant pass) – nearest Face-off Spot in the zone from which the pass or shot originated that gives the offending Team the least amount of “territorial advantage” (even if deflected off an attacking or defending Player or an official). (III) If the defending Player is pressured or about to be checked by an attacking Player – nearest Face-off Spot in the zone from which the pass or shot originated that gives the offending Team the least amount of “territorial advantage” (even if deflected off an attacking or defending Player or an official). (IV) If deemed to be an “intentional off-side” – Face-off Spot in the offending Team’s End Zone. When the Linesperson signals a “Delayed Off-side” and a defending Player shoots the puck which goes over the Protection Glass and out of play, the ensuing “face-off” shall be conducted at one of the Defending Zone End Zone Face-off Spots and the defending Player would be assessed a Minor Penalty. (Rule 63 – Delaying the Game) When the Linesperson signals a “Delayed Off-side” and the original shot deflects off a defending Player and out of play, the ensuing “face-off” shall take place at the nearest Face-off Spot in the zone from where the puck was shot. When the defending Team is about to be penalized in the Defending Zone and the Linesperson has a “Delayed Off-side” signaled against the attacking Team on the same play, the ensuing “face-off” shall be conducted at one of the Defending Zone End Zone Face-off Spots.",

The following procedure will be utilized: (I) Shots will be taken at both ends of the ice surface. The fourteen (14) meter wide longitudinal center section of the Rink, between the Face-off Spots in the Neutral and End Zones, will be dryscraped by the ice-resurfacing machine prior to the Penalty Shot Shootout during the time required to organize the program accordingly. (II) The procedure will begin with five (5) different shooters from each Team taking alternate shots. The Skaters do not need to be named beforehand. Eligible to participate in the “Penalty Shot” Shootout will be all Players from both Teams listed on the Official Game Sheet except as specified in article 3 below. (III) Any Skater whose penalty had not been completed when the Overtime period ended is not eligible to be one of the Players selected to take the shots and must remain in the Penalty Box or in the Dressing Room. Also, Players serving penalties assessed during the “Penalty Shot” Shootout must remain in the Penalty Box or in the Dressing Room until the end of the procedure. (IV) The Referee will call the two Captains to the On-ice Officials’ Crease and flip a coin to determine which Team takes the first shot. The winner of the coin toss will have the choice whether their Team will shoot first or second. (V) The Goalkeepers shall defend the same goal as in the Overtime period and remain in the goal when their own team is taking a shot. (VI) The Goalkeepers from each Team may be changed after each shot. (VII) The shots will be taken in accordance with (Rule 24 – Penalty Shot) (VIII) The Players of both Teams will take the shots alternately until a decisive goal is scored. The remaining shots will not be taken. (IX) If the score is still tied after all shots are taken by each Team, the procedure shall continue with a “tiebreak shoot-out”, using the same or new Players. The Team that shot second in the first five Penalty Shot will start first in the “tie-break shots”. The game shall be finished as soon as a duel of two Players brings the decisive result. The same Player can be used for each shot by a Team in the “tie-break shoot-out”. (X) The Official Scorekeeper will record all shots taken, indicating the Players and goals scored. (XI) Only the decisive goal will count in the result of the game. It shall be credited to the Team that scored the goal and charged against the Team that was scored upon. (XII) If a Team declines to participate in the “Penalty Shot” Shootout, the game will be declared as a loss for that Team and the other Team will be awarded 3 points for a win. If a Player declines to take a shot it will be declared \"no score\" for their Team.",

(III) Break number 3: 06.00 (min.) Despite the above indicated time slots, commercial breaks shall not be taken if: a) A goal is scored; b) A penalty shot is called; c) One of the Teams is playing short-handed; d) A fight breaks out on ice; e) An icing infraction is called; f) The net is dislodged accidentally by a defending player (incl. goalkeeper); and g) The puck is shot into the end zone from beyond the center red line and the goalkeeper freezes the puck resulting in a stoppage of play. Exceptions from point e-g above is when a penalty or penalties are assessed in the stoppage that affects the on-ice strength of either team. In the event that a commercial break is not taken during the time slot prescribed above, because of the exceptions above, the missed commercial opportunity shall be made up at the first stoppage of play in the next commercial break time slot. If there is another incident where the second commercial break is missed, this procedure shall continue to repeat itself until all commercial breaks are taken. However, there must always be at least 60 seconds between two commercial breaks. Any extra commercial break taken during a time slot shall follow the procedure described above and they shall be eliminated from the last remaining time slot of that period. They shall not be used to create extra commercial inventory for broadcasters. However, in such instances, the Commercial Coordinator will be instructed to turn on the light and signal the truck that an optional commercial opportunity is being taken. No commercial breaks shall be taken in the final thirty (30) seconds of the first and second periods, as well as during the final two (2) minutes of the third period. No commercial breaks shall be granted during overtime. The Teams shall comply with the following provisions during commercial breaks: a) Goalkeepers will be allowed to go to their respective players’ bench. b) Teams are allowed to change lines once the referee blows the whistle signaling the teams to return to the face-off with 20 seconds remaining in the commercial stoppage. c) These line changes will follow the same protocol as a normal line change during a stoppage of play.",

If two (2) Players are in pursuit of the puck, they are reasonably allowed to push and lean into each other provided that “possession of the puck” remains the sole object of the two (2) Players. A player that makes an illegal hit on an opponent described in this rule will be assessed one of a: (I) Minor Penalty (2’) (II) Major Penalty (5’) and automatic Game Misconduct Penalty If two (2) or more Players are competing for “possession of the puck”, they are not allowed to use the boards to make contact with an opponent to eliminate her from the play, push her into the boards, or pin her along the boards. A Player, who is stationary, is entitled to that area of the ice. It is up to the opponent to avoid body contact with such a Player. If that Player is stationed between the opponent and the puck, the opponent is obliged to skate around the stationary Player. If a Player with the puck is skating directly at an opponent who is stationary, it is the obligation of the puck carrier to “avoid contact”. But, if the puck carrier makes every effort to “avoid contact” and the opponent moves into the puck carrier, that opponent will be assessed at least a Minor Penalty (2’) for an “illegal hit”. Players are allowed to “hold their ground” any time that they have established their position on the ice. No player is required to move out of the way of an oncoming player to avoid a collision. Any move by a Player to step or glide into an opposing Player will be assessed at least a Minor Penalty (2’) for an “illegal hit”.",
