In the first situation above, the point players for the attacking team entered the zone beyond the outer edge of the end zone faceoff circle during an altercation, gathering or “scrum” and therefore, the face-off must be moved to the neutral zone near the blue line of the defending team following the unsuccessful Penalty Shot attempt (Rule 76.2).

What is the Referee’s call if the Team B player’s stick makes contact with the puck preventing it from entering the goal? What is the call if the thrown stick misses the puck completely, but the puck still goes wide of the net? Where do you find this in the rule book?",
                        "answer": "In the first situation, a goal is awarded to Team A, stop play when stick contacts puck. Signaled minor penalty is assessed to Team A. Rule 53.8, and Rule 78.5. In the second situation, play is stopped as soon as puck misses net. It would be unfair to stop play immediately even though both teams receiving penalties, until it is evident the puck will miss net. A minor is assessed to Team A, and Team B player who threw stick shall receive a minor penalty for interference. The stick was thrown in direction, but did not interfere with puck, therefore a minor penalty is assessed. Rule 53.2 (I).",

However, an attacking teammate, picks up the puck and continues in on goal and gets a reasonable chance to score. Is a Penalty Shot still called in this situation?",
                        "answer": "No. Rule 24.8 states that the intent of the rule (awarding a Penalty Shot) is to restore a reasonable scoring opportunity which has been lost. If a teammate is able to gain a reasonable scoring opportunity, then no Penalty Shot should be awarded but the appropriate penalty should be signaled and assessed if a goal is not scored on the play.",

The Team B player tries to skate past the Team A player who is now in the neutral zone as well. Realizing that the Team B player will be on a breakaway, the Team A player hooks the Team B player. The Referee signals a delayed Penalty Shot. While the delay is on, the Team B player continues on the breakaway. The same Team A player catches the Team B player and again infractions the opponent from behind denying a reasonable scoring opportunity. What should the Referee do?",
                        "answer": "The Referee would assess a Penalty Shot to the Team B player that is fouled to restore the lost scoring opportunity and assess the Team A player an additional minor for hooking. This penalty must be served regardless of whether the shot is successful. (Rule 24.6.) NOTE: Two separate infractions (as they relate to Penalty Shots being awarded) means that two things have happened to warrant the assessment of Penalty Shots. For example, a player is fouled from behind on a breakaway, and then a defending player covers the puck in the crease. These would be two separate infractions calling for a Penalty Shot, and therefore, they would be awarded two Penalty Shots. However, in the question above, only one of the two infractions result in a Penalty Shot because only one of the infractions meets all the criteria for a Penalty Shot. The first infraction no longer denies the puck carrier a reasonable chance to score since the player is able to continue the breakaway (Rule 24.8). Therefore, the first infraction is assessed as a minor penalty.",

However, there are three exceptions to this: a. If the goalkeeper on the bench comes into the game at a stoppage of play to replace the goalkeeper on the ice who has been injured, they cannot switch places until the next stoppage of play. Rule 8.2 b. If the team chooses to replace their goalkeeper to defend against a Penalty Shot, the replacement goalkeeper must remain in the game until the next stoppage of play. Rule 24.2. c: In overtime, once the goalkeeper has been removed for an extra attacker, the goalkeeper must wait until the next stoppage of play before returning to the ice. Any attempt to return to the ice prior to the next stoppage of play (“on the fly”) shall be deemed to be an illegal substitution and a bench minor penalty shall be assessed. Rule 74.5 It should be noted that the reference to goalkeepers’ substitution in Rule 82.1 last paragraph, pertains to changing goalkeepers during a stoppage of play and is not applicable for the scenario presented in this question.",

Rule 84.4 states that “any player whose penalty had not been completed when the Overtime period ended is not eligible to be one of the Players selected to take the shots and must remain in the Penalty Box or in the Dressing Room. Also, Players serving penalties assessed during the “Penalty Shot” Shootout must remain in the Penalty Box or in the Dressing Room until the end of the procedure.\" Since a goalkeeper does not actually \"serve\" a ten-minute misconduct, the goalkeeper may continue in the Shootout. However, the player designated to serve the misconduct for the goalkeeper becomes ineligible to participate in the Shootout (which would also be true if the player is serving the goalkeeper's misconduct at the time the Shootout begins). See also Rule 27.3. NOTE: when the goalkeeper is assessed the misconduct during the Shootout, the team must designate a player who has not yet participated in the Shootout to serve the misconduct penalty. This is consistent with the procedure during the game whereby the team of the penalized goalkeeper is required to lose the services of a player for the duration of the goalkeeper's penalty(ies).",
