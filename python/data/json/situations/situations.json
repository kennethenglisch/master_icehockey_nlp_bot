                        "answer": "Common sense would suggest that since the delayed off-side was still in effect, the face-off should be conducted in the neutral zone just outside Team A’s zone. Rule 8.1.",

The play is stopped when Team B gains possession and control of the puck. Team A4 is not injured, but the trainer comes on to the ice to attend to the player. Even though the play was stopped for the penalty, is Team A4 allowed to stay on the ice? Where do you find this in the book?",
                        "answer": "Regardless of the reason the play was stopped, whenever an injured player is attended to on the ice by a trainer or by medical personnel, such player must be substituted for immediately. The injured player cannot return to the ice until play has resumed. Rule 8.1.",

The player is crawling to the bench when the trainer opens a gate on the side boards, separate from the Players’ Bench, during the play and pulls the injured defender off the ice, and immediately to the dressing room. Is this legal, and where is it in the rule book?",
                        "answer": "No this is not a legal player change. If an injured player wishes to retire from the ice and be replaced by a substitute, the player must do so at the Players’ Bench and no other exit. Therefore, a bench minor penalty shall be imposed. Rule 8.1.",
