A Team shall be composed of twenty-two (22) Players. No more than twenty (20) Skaters and two (2) Goalkeepers shall be permitted. For the purposes of these playing rules, any reference to “Player” shall refer to both Skaters and Goalkeepers. Any reference to “Goalkeeper” shall mean that the section of the rule is specific to Goalkeepers. Prior to the start of each game, the Team Manager or Coach of each Team shall list on a “Line-up / Roster Sheet” the Players who are eligible to play in the game. For a Team to play a game, it must be able to put on the ice at least five (5) Skaters and one (1) Goalkeeper at the beginning of the game. Only eligible Players can be listed on the Roster Sheet and play in a Game. Players who are registered for a tournament or event but who are not listed on the Official Game Sheet can participate in the pre-game warm-up. The Coach must submit the “Line-up / Roster Sheet” to the Official Scorekeeper at least sixty (60) minutes prior to the start of the game. The Official Game Sheet with the listed names and numbers of all eligible Players must be handed to the On-ice Game Officials before the Game, and no change shall be permitted to the Official Game Sheet after the commencement of the Game. Prior to the Game, if an Official (on-ice or off-ice) notices that a Player is in uniform but has not been included on the Official Game Sheet, the Referee shall bring this to the attention of the offending Team so that the necessary correction can be made to the Official Game Sheet with no penalty assessed. At IIHF Championships, a representative from each Team must confirm the “Line-up / Roster Sheet” at least two (2) minutes prior to the start of the Game, and Players may be added or deleted up to the “opening face-off”.

When play has been stopped by the Referee or Linesperson due to an injured Player, or whenever an injured Player is attended to on the ice by the Coach or Medical Personnel, such Player must be substituted for immediately. This injured Player cannot return to the ice until play has resumed. When play is stopped for an injured Player, the ensuing “face-off” shall be conducted at the Face-off Spot in the zone nearest the location of the puck when the play was stopped. When the injured Player’s Team has control of the puck in the Attacking Zone, the “face-off” shall be conducted at the nearest Faceoff Spot in the Neutral Zone. When the injured Player is in their Defending Zone and the attacking Team is in “possession of the puck” in the Attacking Zone, the “face-off” shall be conducted at the nearest Face-off Spot in the defending Team’s zone. A player who lies on the ice either feigning an injury or refusing to get up off the ice will be issued a Minor Penalty.",

During the play, if an injured Player wishes to retire from the ice and be replaced by a substitute, they must do so at the Players’ Bench and not through any other exit leading from the Rink. This is not a legal Player change and therefore when a violation occurs, a Bench-minor Penalty shall be imposed. If a penalized Player has been injured, they may proceed to the Dressing Room without taking a seat in the Penalty Box. The penalized Team shall immediately put a substitute Player in the Penalty Box, who shall serve the penalty until the injured Player is able to return to the game. They would replace their Teammate in the Penalty Box at the next stoppage of play. For violation of this rule, a Bench Minor Penalty shall be imposed. Should the injured penalized Player who has been replaced in the Penalty Box return to their Players’ Bench prior to the expiration of their penalty, they shall not be eligible to play until their penalty has expired. This includes coincidental penalties when their substitute is still in the Penalty Box awaiting a stoppage in play. The injured Player must wait until their substitute has been released from the Penalty Box before they are eligible to play. If, however, there is a stoppage of play prior to the expiration of their penalty, they must then replace their Teammate in the Penalty Box and is then eligible to return once their penalty has expired. When a Player is injured so that they cannot continue play or go to their Players’ Bench, the play shall not be stopped until the injured Player’s Team has secured control of the puck. If the Player’s Team is in “control of the puck” at the time of injury, play shall be stopped immediately unless their Team is in a scoring position. In the case where it is obvious that a Player has sustained a serious injury, the Referee and/or Linesperson may stop the play immediately. Where an injury has occurred to a Player and there is a stoppage of play, a Team Doctor (or other Medical Personnel) may go onto the ice to attend to the injured Player without waiting for the Referee’s consent.

Should they do so, the play shall be stopped once their Team has gained control of the puck and a Minor Penalty shall be assessed to the offending Player. If a Player’s chin strap becomes unfastened during game action, but the helmet stays on their head, they may continue to play until the next stoppage or until they leave the ice. A Player who intentionally removes an opponent’s helmet during play shall be assessed a Minor Penalty for “Roughing”. (Rule 51 – Roughing) When a goalkeeper is hit on the face mask by a hard shot with the puck and the Referee believes the Goalkeeper is or may be dazed by that hard shot, the Referee may stop play for safety reasons, if there is no immediate scoring chance for the attacking Team. When a Goalkeeper has lost their helmet and/or face mask and their Team has control of the puck, play shall be stopped immediately to allow the Goalkeeper the opportunity to recollect their helmet and/or face mask. When the opposing Team has control of the puck, play shall only be stopped if there is no immediate and impending scoring opportunity. This stoppage of play must be made by the Referee. When play is stopped because the Goalkeeper has lost their helmet and/ or face mask, the ensuing “face-off” shall take place at one of the defending Team’s End Zone Face-off Spots. When a Goalkeeper deliberately removes their helmet and/or face mask to secure a stoppage of play, the Referee shall stop play as outlined above and assess the Goalkeeper a Minor Penalty for “Delay of Game”. (Rule 63 – Delaying the Game) If the Goalkeeper deliberately removes their helmet and/or face mask when the opposing Team is on a breakaway (where the criteria’s for a penalty shot is meet except for a foul from behind), or during the course of a “Penalty Shot” or shootout attempt, the Referee shall award a goal to the non-offending Team.",

(Rule 12 – Illegal Equipment) Dangerous Equipment includes wearing a visor in a way that may cause injury to an opponent, wearing non-approved equipment, using dangerous or illegal skates or stick, failing to wear equipment under the uniform (except gloves, helmet, and goalkeeper’s pads), and cutting the palm out of one or both gloves. The use of pads or protectors made of metal, or of any other material likely to cause injury to an opposing Player is prohibited. Referees have the authority to prohibit any equipment they feel may cause injury to any participant in the game. Failure to comply with the Referees’ instructions shall result in a Minor Penalty for “Delay of Game”. A mask or protector of a design approved by the IIHF may be worn by a Player who has sustained a facial injury. In the first instance, the injured Player shall be entitled to wear any protective device prescribed by the Team Doctor. If any opposing Team objects to the device, it may record its objection with the IIHF.

(Rule 53 – Throwing Equipment) The Goalkeeper shall not receive a penalty for receiving the stick. A Goalkeeper whose stick is “broken or illegal” may not go to the Players’ Bench for a replacement but must receive their stick from a Teammate as described above. A Goalkeeper may participate in the play using a Skater’s stick until such time as they are legally provided with a replacement Goalkeeper’s stick. For an infraction of this rule, a Minor Penalty shall be imposed on the Goalkeeper.",

In the event a penalized Player is not in the Penalty Box, the Penalty Timekeeper should notify the Referees and prevent the game from resuming until the Player is there.",

If an expanded review is required on any potential goal, the Video Review Consultant shall instruct that the in-arena horn be sounded and the Public Address Announcer will make an announcement that the “play is under review.” Once the play has been reviewed and deemed a goal, the goal will be announced in the normal manner. If the review reveals that the goal should be disallowed, the Referee shall announce the reason for the disallowed goal. When the Video Review Consultant observes an incident involving a potential goal that was undetected by the On-ice Officials, the Off-ice Official will contact the Referee at the first stoppage of play and inform them that a review of the play is in progress. When a video review is initiated, the Public Address Announcer will make an announcement that “the play is under review.” Should the Video Review Consultant be able to determine that a goal has been scored through the use of video replay, and play on the ice has nonetheless continued, the Video Review Consultant shall instruct that the in-arena horn be sounded to stop play immediately, and the goal will be awarded. Should the first stoppage of play following an apparent goal coincide with the end of a period, the On-ice Official(s) will instruct both Teams to remain at their respective Players’ Bench until the Video Review of the play can be completed. If the review reveals that the goal should be counted, the clock (including penalty time clocks, if applicable) shall be reset to the time the goal was scored. If the review reveals that no goal was scored, no adjustment to the time clock(s) will be made. Only one goal can be awarded at any stoppage of play. If  an  apparent goal was scored by Team A and is subsequently confirmed as a goal by Video Review,  any goal scored by Team B during the period of time between the apparent goal by Team A and the stoppage of play (Team B’s goal), the Team B goal will not be awarded. If the apparent goal by Team A is deemed to have entered the goal illegally (e.g., a “distinct kicking motion”), the goal will be disallowed. No goal will be awarded to Team B either in this circumstance since the play should have been stopped at the time of the apparent goal. The clock (including penalty time clocks, if applicable) shall be reset to the time of Team A’s apparent goal – whether awarded or disallowed. Any penalties signaled during the period of time between the apparent goal and the next stoppage of play shall be assessed in the normal manner, except when a Minor Penalty is to be assessed to the Team scored upon and is therefore nullified by the scoring of the goal – refer to (Rule 16.2. – Minor Penalties) (Rule 18.2. – Double-minor Penalties) If an infraction happens after the first stoppage of play following an apparent goal (infraction after the whistle) by either Team, it is assessed and served in the normal manner regardless as to the decision rendered by Video Review. When the Referee indicates there is a Video Review in progress, all Players (with the exception of the Goalkeepers) should proceed to their respective Players’ Bench immediately, and failure to do so may result in a Game Misconduct Penalty for offending Player(s) and shall be reported to the Proper Authorities. Any potential goal requiring Video Review must be reviewed prior to and/or during the next stoppage of play. No goal may be awarded (or disallowed) as a result of a Video Review once the play has resumed. The Video Review Consultant will connect directly with the Referee(s) at ice level to assist with the review of any close play or disputed goal. The On-ice Officials (Referees or Linespersons) decision shall be final. For more information refer to IIHF Technology Codes & Regulations.",

In such cases, a “face-off” will ensue in the ice location where it would have otherwise occurred had the on-ice infraction been called properly. If one or more penalties (Minor or Major) are assessed between the time of the missed infraction and the Video Review that disallows the apparent goal, the offending Team(s) (and responsible Player(s)) will still be required to serve the penalty(ies) identified and assessed, and the time of the penalty(ies) will be recorded as the time at which the play should have been stopped for the missed infraction. In cases where a Challenge has been initiated for a “goal” call on the ice where the defending Team claims that the goal should have been disallowed due to the “Interference on the Goalkeeper,” as described in (Rule 69 – Interference on the Goalkeeper) and a determination is made that the “call on the ice” should be overturned, the goal will be disallowed, and a “face-off” will ensue in the nearest Neutral Zone Face-off Spot outside the Attacking Zone. The Video Review process on these plays will be utilized exclusively for purposes of overturning a “goal” call on the ice – it will not be utilized for any other purpose, including, specifically, for assessing Minor or Major Penalties for Goalkeeper Interference. In cases where a Challenge has been initiated for a “no goal” call on the ice despite the puck having entered the net, where the On-ice Officials have determined that the attacking Team was guilty of “Interference on the Goalkeeper,” and a determination is made that the “call on the ice” should be overturned, the goal will be allowed an  a “face-off” will ensue at Center ice. (Rule 69 – Interference on the Goalkeeper) If a penalty for “Interference on a Goalkeeper” was indicated and based on the Video Review, no such action was committed by the attacking Player, no penalty shall be assessed for such an infraction. All other penalties not related to “Interference on a Goalkeeper” should be assessed and served in a normal manner.

                    "context": "A Player who obstructs or prevents an opponent “without possession of the puck” from skating, receiving a pass, or moving about the ice freely is considered as “interference”. A “late-hit” constitutes reckless endangerment of a Player who “no longer has control or possession of the puck”. Any Player who is in the process of “abandoning” or “losing control or possession of the puck” is subject to a bodycheck so long as the aggressor is in the immediate vicinity of the Skater with the puck. A strict standard on acts of interference must be adhered to in all areas of the Rink. Body Position: “Body position” shall be determined as the Player skating in front of or beside their opponent, traveling in the same direction. A Player who is behind an opponent, who does not have the puck, may not use their stick, body, or free hand in order to restrain their opponent, but must skate in order to gain or reestablish their “proper position” in order to make a check. A Player is allowed the ice they are standing on (body position) and are not required to move in order to let an opponent proceed. A Player may “block the path” of an opponent provided they are in front of their opponent and moving in the same direction. Moving laterally and without “establishing body position”, then making contact with the non-puck carrier is not permitted and will be penalized as “interference”. A Player is always entitled to use their “body position” to lengthen an opponent’s path to the puck, provided their stick is not utilized (to make themself “bigger” and therefore considerably lengthening the distance their opponent must travel to get where they are going); their “free hand” is not used, and they do not take advantage of their “body position” to deliver an otherwise illegal check. Possession of the Puck: The last Player to touch the puck, other than the Goalkeeper, shall be considered the Player in “possession”. The Player deemed in “possession” of the puck may be checked legally, provided the check is rendered immediately following them “loss of control” and their opponent still finds themself within an “objectively reasonable window of opportunity” to deliver such a check refer to Rule 56.4 – Interference . Restrain: The actions of a Player who does not have “body position”, but instead uses illegal means (e.g., “hook” with stick; “hold” with hands, “trip” with the stick or in any manner) to impede an opponent who is not in “possession” of the puck. Illegal means are acts which allow a Player to “establish,  maintain or restore body position” other than by skating. Pick: A “pick” is the action of a Player who checks an opponent who is not in “possession” of the puck and is unaware of the impending check/hit. A Player who is aware of an impending hit, not deemed to be a legal “battle for the puck,” may not be interfered with by a Player delivering a “pick.” A Player delivering a “pick” is one who moves into an opponent’s path without initially having “body position”, thereby taking them “out of the play”. When this is done, an “interference” penalty shall be assessed. Free Hand: When a “free hand” is used to hold, pull, tug, grab or physically restrain an opponent from moving “freely”, this must be penalized as “holding”. The “free hand” may be used by a Player to “fend off” an opponent or their stick but may not be used to hold an opponent’s stick or body. Stick: A Player who does not have “body position” on their opponent, who uses their stick (either the blade or the shaft, including the butt-end of the shaft) to impede or prevent their opponent from moving “freely” on the ice shall be assessed a “hooking” penalty.

The determining factor shall be the position of the puck when it was shot or batted by the offending Player. If contact with the puck occurs while the puck is inside the Defending Zone, and subsequently goes out of play, the Minor Penalty shall be assessed. When the puck is shot over the Protective Glass surrounding the Players’ Bench, the penalty will be assessed. Note: When the puck is shot into the Players’ Bench, the penalty will not apply. When the puck goes out of the playing area directly off a “face-off”, no penalty shall be assessed; (IV) On any Player who delays the game by deliberately displacing a Goal Post from its normal position.

Note: If a Player deliberately displaces a Goal Post from its normal position when an opponent has an imminent scoring opportunity on an open net, a goal may be awarded by the Referee (Rule 63.7 – Awarded Goal) (V) On a Player other than the Goalkeeper who deliberately falls on or gathers the puck into their body; Note: Any Player who drops to their knees to block a shot should not be penalized if the puck is shot under them or becomes lodged in their clothing or equipment but any use of the hands to make the puck unplayable should be penalized promptly; (VI) On a Goalkeeper who “races out” of their Goal Crease in an attempt to beat the attacking Player to the puck and instead of playing the puck jumps on the puck causing a stoppage of play; Note: If a Goalkeeper comes out of their Goal Crease to “cut down the angle” on a shot and after making the save covers the puck, this shall be legal. (VII) On a Goalkeeper who, when they are in their own Goal Crease, deliberately falls on or gathers the puck into their body or who holds or places the puck against any part of the goal in such a manner as to cause a stoppage of play unless they are actually being checked by an opponent; (VIII) On a Goalkeeper who plays the puck outside of the Designated Area behind the net. The determining factor shall be the position of the puck. Note: The Minor Penalty will not be assessed when a Goalkeeper plays the puck while maintaining skate contact with the Goal Crease. (IX) For adjustments to clothing, equipment, skates, or sticks. Note: No penalty should be assessed when a water bottle is delivered to a Goalkeeper, however, this should be conducted during time-outs and if, in the opinion of the Referee, it is being done to intentionally delay the game, a Minor Penalty may be assessed.

Regarding to a Goalkeeper, this rule applies outside of their Goal Crease area; (II) On any Player who deliberately shoots or bats (using their hand or stick) the puck outside the playing area (from anywhere on the ice surface) during the play or after a stoppage of play; (III) On any Player who shoots or bats (using their hand or stick) the puck directly (non-deflected) out of the playing surface from their Defending Zone, except where there is no Protective Glass. The determining factor shall be the position of the puck when it was shot or batted by the offending Player. If contact with the puck occurs while the puck is inside the Defending Zone, and subsequently goes out of play, the Minor Penalty shall be assessed. When the puck is shot over the Protective Glass surrounding the Players’ Bench, the penalty will be assessed. Note: When the puck is shot into the Players’ Bench, the penalty will not apply. When the puck goes out of the playing area directly off a “face-off”, no penalty shall be assessed; (IV) On any Player who delays the game by deliberately displacing a Goal Post from its normal position. The Referee shall stop play immediately when the offending Team gains “control” of the puck. Note: If a Player deliberately displaces a Goal Post from its normal position when an opponent has an imminent scoring opportunity on an open net, a goal may be awarded by the Referee (Rule 63.7 – Awarded Goal) (V) On a Player other than the Goalkeeper who deliberately falls on or gathers the puck into their body; Note: Any Player who drops to their knees to block a shot should not be penalized if the puck is shot under them or becomes lodged in their clothing or equipment but any use of the hands to make the puck unplayable should be penalized promptly; (VI) On a Goalkeeper who “races out” of their Goal Crease in an attempt to beat the attacking Player to the puck and instead of playing the puck jumps on the puck causing a stoppage of play; Note: If a Goalkeeper comes out of their Goal Crease to “cut down the angle” on a shot and after making the save covers the puck, this shall be legal. (VII) On a Goalkeeper who, when they are in their own Goal Crease, deliberately falls on or gathers the puck into their body or who holds or places the puck against any part of the goal in such a manner as to cause a stoppage of play unless they are actually being checked by an opponent; (VIII) On a Goalkeeper who plays the puck outside of the Designated Area behind the net. The determining factor shall be the position of the puck. Note: The Minor Penalty will not be assessed when a Goalkeeper plays the puck while maintaining skate contact with the Goal Crease. (IX) For adjustments to clothing, equipment, skates, or sticks. Note: No penalty should be assessed when a water bottle is delivered to a Goalkeeper, however, this should be conducted during time-outs and if, in the opinion of the Referee, it is being done to intentionally delay the game, a Minor Penalty may be assessed. (X) No delay shall be permitted for the repair or adjustment of Goalkeeper’s equipment. If adjustments are required, the Goalkeeper shall leave the ice and their place shall be taken by the substitute Goalkeeper immediately. For an infraction of this rule by a Goalkeeper, a Minor Penalty shall be imposed.",

When a game is cancelled, the Referee must report all circumstances to the Proper Authority that shall investigate all cancelled games to decide the outcome of the game. In addition, the Proper Authorities may assess additional Disciplinary Measures on any Team or Team member in connection to the cancelled game. For more information refer to IIHF Disciplinary Code.",

There shall be no time penalty to the Team making the premature substitution, but the resulting “face-off” will take place at the Center ice Face-off Spot when play is stopped beyond the Center red line. When play is stopped prior to the Center red line, the resulting “face-off” shall be conducted at the nearest Face-off Spot in the zone where the play was stopped. In all other situations not covered in the above, a Minor Penalty may result for “too many Players on the ice” (Rule 74 – Too Many Players on the Ice)",

If in the course of a substitution either the Player(s) entering the play or the Player(s) retiring is struck by the puck accidentally, the play will not be stopped, and no penalty will be called. During the play, the Player retiring from the ice must do so at the Players’ Bench and not through any other exit leading from the Rink. This is not a legal Player change and therefore when a violation occurs, a Bench Minor Penalty shall be imposed. A Player coming onto the ice as a substitute Player is considered on the ice once both of their skates are on the ice. If they play the puck or interfere with an opponent while still on the Players’ Bench, they shall be penalized under (Rule 56 – Interference) A retiring Player (coming off the ice) who has one skate on the ice and one skate off the ice in the Players’ Bench is considered as “off the ice”.",

Nonetheless, this “physical contact” prior to the dropping of the puck shall be deemed as a “face-off” violation and the center will be warned by the Linesperson that the Team has committed a “face-off” violation and any subsequent violation will result in a Bench Minor Penalty for “Delay of Game” – “face-off” violation being assessed. “Face-off” encroachment may be applied during “face-offs” at any of the nine (9) Face-off Spots on the playing surface However, since no such lines are painted on the ice at the four (4) Face-off Spots adjacent to the Blue Lines, Linespersons shall use their judgment as to whether or not a violation has occurred. All Players, other than the centers, shall be uniformly back from the “face-off” location similar to being outside the Face-off Circle for “face-offs” in the End Zones.",

                                        "text": "If a center should move prematurely prior to the “face-off”, or if the Referee or Linesperson shall have dropped the puck unfairly, the “face-off” shall be considered a “face-off” violation. A warning shall be issued to the offending Team and the “face-off” must be conducted again. When two (2) “face-off” violations” have been committed by the same Team during the same “face-off”, this Team shall be penalized with a Bench Minor Penalty to the offending Team. This penalty shall be announced as a “Bench Minor Penalty for “Delay of Game” – Face-off Violation.” “Face-off” violations shall be summarized as follows (any of the four (4) On-ice Officials may identify a “face-off” violation): (I) Encroachment by any Player other than the center into the “face-off” area prior to the puck being dropped. Players on the perimeter of the Face-off Circle must keep both skates outside the Face-off Circle – skate contact with the line is permitted. If a Player's skate crosses the line into the Face-off Circle prior to the drop of the puck, this shall be deemed as a “face-off” violation. A Player's stick may be inside the Face-off Circle provided there is no physical contact with their opponent or their opponent's stick. (II) Encroachment by any Player into the area between the hash marks on the outer edges of the Face-off Circle prior to the puck being dropped. Players must also ensure that both of their skates do not cross their respective hash marks. Contact with the line with their skate is permitted. If a Player's skate crosses the line into the area between the hash marks prior to the drop of the puck, this shall be deemed as a “face-off” violation. A Player's stick may be inside the area between the hash marks provided there is no physical contact with their opponent or their opponent's stick. (III) Any physical contact with an opponent prior to the puck being dropped. If either Player taking the “face-off” makes helmet-to-helmet contact with their opponent, they must receive a first “face-off” violation warning. If the Linesperson cannot differentiate which Player initiated the contact, both Players must receive a first “face-off” violation warning. (IV) Failure by either center taking the “face-off” to “properly position themself behind the restraining lines” or place their stick on the ice – as outlined in Rule 76.4 – Face-off Procedure – Centers. \"Properly position themself behind the restraining lines\" shall mean that the center must place their feet on either side of the restraining lines that are parallel to the side Boards (contact with the lines is permissible), and the toe of the blade of their skates must not cross over the restraining lines that are perpendicular to the side Boards as they approach the Face-off Spot. The blade of the stick must then be placed on the ice, at least the toe of the blade of the stick, in the designated white area of the Face-off Spot and must remain there until the puck is dropped. (V) Failure to comply with this positioning and “face-off” procedure will result in a “face-off” violation. Whenever a Team has committed two (2) “face-off” violations during the same “face-off”, the Referee shall immediately assess the offending Team a Bench Minor Penalty for “Delay of Game”. This penalty shall be announced as a Bench Minor Penalty for Delay of Game – Face-off Violation. Players who are late to the “face-off” location and therefore in an off-side position for the ensuing “face-off” will be warned once in the game by the Referee. This warning will also be given to the offending Team’s Coach. In this situation, the offending Team’s center will not receive a warning for a “face-off” violation. Any subsequent violation shall result in a Bench Minor Penalty for “Delay of Game” being assessed to the offending Team. This penalty shall be announced as a “Bench Minor Penalty for “Delay of Game” – Slow Proceeding to Face-off Location. In the conduct of any “face-off” at any of the nine (9) Face-off Spots on the playing surface, no Player facing-off shall make any physical contact with their opponent’s body by means of their own body or by their stick except in the course of playing the puck after the “face-off” has been completed. For violation of this rule, the Referee may, at their discretion impose a Minor Penalty or penalties on the Player(s) whose action(s) caused the “physical contact”. Nonetheless, this “physical contact” prior to the dropping of the puck shall be deemed as a “face-off” violation and the center will be warned by the Linesperson that the Team has committed a “face-off” violation and any subsequent violation will result in a Bench Minor Penalty for “Delay of Game” – “face-off” violation being assessed. “Face-off” encroachment may be applied during “face-offs” at any of the nine (9) Face-off Spots on the playing surface However, since no such lines are painted on the ice at the four (4) Face-off Spots adjacent to the Blue Lines, Linespersons shall use their judgment as to whether or not a violation has occurred. All Players, other than the centers, shall be uniformly back from the “face-off” location similar to being outside the Face-off Circle for “face-offs” in the End Zones.",

If this is done by a Player on a “Penalty Shot” or Shootout attempt, the shot shall be stopped immediately and considered complete. (Rule 60 – High-sticking)",

For the purpose of interpretation of the rule, there are two judgments required for \"icing the puck\". The Linesperson must first determine that the puck will cross the Goal Line. Once the Linesperson determines that the puck will cross the Goal Line, “icing” is completed upon the determination as to which Player (attacking or defending) would first touch the puck. This decision by the Linesperson will be made by no later than the instant the first Player reaches the End Zone “face-off” dots with the Player's skate being the determining factor. Should the puck be shot down the ice in such a manner that it travels around the Boards and/or back towards the End Zone “face-off” dots, the same procedure shall be in effect in that the Linesperson shall determine within a similar distance as to who will have touched the puck first. For clarification, the determining factor is which Player would first touch the puck, not which Player would first reach the End Zone “face-off” dots. If the “race for the puck” is too close to determine by the time the first Player reaches the End Zone “face-off” dots, “icing” shall be called. The puck striking or deflecting off an Official does not automatically nullify a potential “icing”. If there is no “race” for the puck, icing will be not called until a defending skater crosses its defending blue line and the puck crosses the goal line (not between the goal posts).",

This includes the situation whereby the opposing Team, while in the process of making Player substitutions during the play, are able to play the puck, but choose not to do so to avoid being called for “too many Players on the ice”. “Icing” should not be called.

Once the line change procedure has been completed, no additional Player substitutions shall be permitted until the “face-off” has been completed legally and play has resumed, except when a penalty or penalties are imposed that affect the “on-ice strength” of either or both Teams. This may include penalties imposed following the completion of the line change and prior to the “face-off”, or due to a penalty assessed for a “face-off” violation – refer to Rule 82.2 – Line Change – Procedure. A Team that is in violation of (Rule 63.8 – Delaying the Game) or (Rule 81 – Icing) shall not be permitted to make any Player substitutions prior to the ensuing “face-off”. However, a Team shall be permitted to make a Player substitution to replace a Goalkeeper who had been substituted for an extra attacker, to replace an injured Player, or when a penalty has been assessed which affects the “on-ice strength” of either Team. The determination of Players on ice will be made when the puck leaves the offending Player’s stick. Goalkeepers’ substitution during a game will be conducted within the same time frame as a regular line change. No extra time will be allotted to the Goalkeeper coming off the bench, except in the case where an injury to a Goalkeeper occurs.",

(II) If shot into the Attacking Zone (or errant pass) – nearest Face-off Spot in the zone from which the pass or shot originated that gives the offending Team the least amount of “territorial advantage” (even if deflected off an attacking or defending Player or an official). (III) If the defending Player is pressured or about to be checked by an attacking Player – nearest Face-off Spot in the zone from which the pass or shot originated that gives the offending Team the least amount of “territorial advantage” (even if deflected off an attacking or defending Player or an official). (IV) If deemed to be an “intentional off-side” – Face-off Spot in the offending Team’s End Zone. When the Linesperson signals a “Delayed Off-side” and a defending Player shoots the puck which goes over the Protection Glass and out of play, the ensuing “face-off” shall be conducted at one of the Defending Zone End Zone Face-off Spots and the defending Player would be assessed a Minor Penalty. (Rule 63 – Delaying the Game) When the Linesperson signals a “Delayed Off-side” and the original shot deflects off a defending Player and out of play, the ensuing “face-off” shall take place at the nearest Face-off Spot in the zone from where the puck was shot. When the defending Team is about to be penalized in the Defending Zone and the Linesperson has a “Delayed Off-side” signaled against the attacking Team on the same play, the ensuing “face-off” shall be conducted at one of the Defending Zone End Zone Face-off Spots.",

Once Player strength reaches 4 on 4, 5 on 4 or 5 on 5, at the next stoppage player strength is adjusted to 3 on 3 or 4 on 3 as appropriate. At no time will a Team have less than three (3) Skaters on the ice. This may require a fourth (4th) and/or fifth (5th) Skater to be added in the event penalties are assessed. If a Team is penalized in Overtime, Teams play 4 on 3. If both Teams are penalized with Minor Penalties at the same stoppage of play (with no other penalties in effect), Teams will continue to play 3 on 3. In Overtime, if a team is penalized such that a two-man (2) advantage is called for, then the offending Team will remain at three (3) Skaters while the non-offending Team will be permitted five (5) Skaters. At the first stoppage of play after the two-man (2) advantage is no longer in effect, the “numerical strength” of the Teams will revert back to 4 on 3 or 3 on 3, as appropriate.",

If the attacking Team shoots the puck into the zone and a “Delayed Off-side” is indicated, or if the attacking Team commits a game flow infraction such as contacting the puck with a “high-stick” or “batting the puck with a glove” (causing a stoppage of play), the ensuing “face-off” shall be in the Neutral Zone outside the offending Team’s Attacking Zone.",
