Nevertheless, the Referee shall not stop play until the attacking Team has “lost possession” of the puck to the defending Team. The intention of this rule is to restore a reasonable “scoring opportunity” which has been lost. If, however, the Player fouled is able to recover and obtain a “reasonable scoring opportunity” (or a Teammate is able to gain a reasonable scoring opportunity), no “Penalty Shot” should be awarded but the appropriate penalty should be signaled and assessed if a goal is not scored on the play. “Control of the puck” means the act of propelling the puck with the stick, hand, or feet. In order for a “Penalty Shot” to be awarded for a Player being fouled from behind, the following four (4) criteria must have been met: (I) The infraction must have taken place in the Neutral or Attacking Zone (i.e., over the puck carrier’s own Blue Line); (II) The infraction must have been committed from behind (except a foul committed from the front by the Goalkeeper on a “breakaway” situation); (III) The Player in “possession and control” (or, in the judgment of the Referee, the Player clearly would have “obtained possession and control” of the puck) must have been denied a reasonable chance to score. The fact that the Player got a shot off does not automatically eliminate this play from the “Penalty Shot” consideration criteria. If the infraction was from behind and the Player was denied a “more reasonable scoring opportunity” due to the infraction, then the “Penalty Shot” should still be awarded; (IV) The Player in “possession and control” (or, in the judgment of the Referee, the Player clearly would have “obtained possession and control”) must have had no opposing Player between themself and the Goalkeeper. If, in the opinion of the Referee, a Player makes contact with the puck first and subsequently trips the opponent in so doing, no “Penalty Shot” will be awarded, but a Minor Penalty for “tripping” shall be assessed. It should be noted that if the attacking Player manages to get around the Goalkeeper and has no defending Player between them and the “open goal”, and they are fouled from behind by the Goalkeeper or another defending Player, no goal can be awarded since the Goalkeeper is still on the ice.

Nevertheless, the Referee shall not stop play until the attacking Team has “lost possession” of the puck to the defending Team. The intention of this rule is to restore a reasonable “scoring opportunity” which has been lost. If, however, the Player fouled is able to recover and obtain a “reasonable scoring opportunity” (or a Teammate is able to gain a reasonable scoring opportunity), no “Penalty Shot” should be awarded but the appropriate penalty should be signaled and assessed if a goal is not scored on the play. “Control of the puck” means the act of propelling the puck with the stick, hand, or feet. In order for a “Penalty Shot” to be awarded for a Player being fouled from behind, the following four (4) criteria must have been met: (I) The infraction must have taken place in the Neutral or Attacking Zone (i.e., over the puck carrier’s own Blue Line); (II) The infraction must have been committed from behind (except a foul committed from the front by the Goalkeeper on a “breakaway” situation); (III) The Player in “possession and control” (or, in the judgment of the Referee, the Player clearly would have “obtained possession and control” of the puck) must have been denied a reasonable chance to score. The fact that the Player got a shot off does not automatically eliminate this play from the “Penalty Shot” consideration criteria. If the infraction was from behind and the Player was denied a “more reasonable scoring opportunity” due to the infraction, then the “Penalty Shot” should still be awarded; (IV) The Player in “possession and control” (or, in the judgment of the Referee, the Player clearly would have “obtained possession and control”) must have had no opposing Player between themself and the Goalkeeper. If, in the opinion of the Referee, a Player makes contact with the puck first and subsequently trips the opponent in so doing, no “Penalty Shot” will be awarded, but a Minor Penalty for “tripping” shall be assessed. It should be noted that if the attacking Player manages to get around the Goalkeeper and has no defending Player between them and the “open goal”, and they are fouled from behind by the Goalkeeper or another defending Player, no goal can be awarded since the Goalkeeper is still on the ice. A “Penalty Shot” would be awarded.",

                    "context": "A Player who obstructs or prevents an opponent “without possession of the puck” from skating, receiving a pass, or moving about the ice freely is considered as “interference”. A “late-hit” constitutes reckless endangerment of a Player who “no longer has control or possession of the puck”. Any Player who is in the process of “abandoning” or “losing control or possession of the puck” is subject to a bodycheck so long as the aggressor is in the immediate vicinity of the Skater with the puck. A strict standard on acts of interference must be adhered to in all areas of the Rink. Body Position: “Body position” shall be determined as the Player skating in front of or beside their opponent, traveling in the same direction. A Player who is behind an opponent, who does not have the puck, may not use their stick, body, or free hand in order to restrain their opponent, but must skate in order to gain or reestablish their “proper position” in order to make a check. A Player is allowed the ice they are standing on (body position) and are not required to move in order to let an opponent proceed. A Player may “block the path” of an opponent provided they are in front of their opponent and moving in the same direction. Moving laterally and without “establishing body position”, then making contact with the non-puck carrier is not permitted and will be penalized as “interference”. A Player is always entitled to use their “body position” to lengthen an opponent’s path to the puck, provided their stick is not utilized (to make themself “bigger” and therefore considerably lengthening the distance their opponent must travel to get where they are going); their “free hand” is not used, and they do not take advantage of their “body position” to deliver an otherwise illegal check. Possession of the Puck: The last Player to touch the puck, other than the Goalkeeper, shall be considered the Player in “possession”. The Player deemed in “possession” of the puck may be checked legally, provided the check is rendered immediately following them “loss of control” and their opponent still finds themself within an “objectively reasonable window of opportunity” to deliver such a check refer to Rule 56.4 – Interference . Restrain: The actions of a Player who does not have “body position”, but instead uses illegal means (e.g., “hook” with stick; “hold” with hands, “trip” with the stick or in any manner) to impede an opponent who is not in “possession” of the puck. Illegal means are acts which allow a Player to “establish,  maintain or restore body position” other than by skating. Pick: A “pick” is the action of a Player who checks an opponent who is not in “possession” of the puck and is unaware of the impending check/hit. A Player who is aware of an impending hit, not deemed to be a legal “battle for the puck,” may not be interfered with by a Player delivering a “pick.” A Player delivering a “pick” is one who moves into an opponent’s path without initially having “body position”, thereby taking them “out of the play”. When this is done, an “interference” penalty shall be assessed. Free Hand: When a “free hand” is used to hold, pull, tug, grab or physically restrain an opponent from moving “freely”, this must be penalized as “holding”. The “free hand” may be used by a Player to “fend off” an opponent or their stick but may not be used to hold an opponent’s stick or body. Stick: A Player who does not have “body position” on their opponent, who uses their stick (either the blade or the shaft, including the butt-end of the shaft) to impede or prevent their opponent from moving “freely” on the ice shall be assessed a “hooking” penalty. {rule_reference_0}",

If, however, in the opinion of the Referee, the attacking Player was pushed or otherwise fouled by a defending Player causing the Goalkeeper to be pushed into the net together with the puck, the goal can be permitted. In the event the puck is under a Player in or around the Goal Crease area (deliberately or otherwise), a goal cannot be scored by pushing this Player together with the puck into the goal. If applicable, the appropriate penalties will be assessed, including a “Penalty Shot” if deemed to be covered in the Goal Crease deliberately. {rule_reference_0}",

If a Player received a warning for a “face-off” violation, they must come into position quickly or risk having the puck dropped by the Linesperson without the Player being set or will result in a Bench Minor Penalty for “Delay of Game” for a second “face-off” violation during the same “face-off”.",

Players who are late to the “face-off” location and therefore in an off-side position for the ensuing “face-off” will be warned once in the game by the Referee. This warning will also be given to the offending Team’s Coach. In this situation, the offending Team’s center will not receive a warning for a “face-off” violation.

If there is any undue delay by either Team in changing Players, the Referee shall order the offending Team or Teams to take their positions immediately and not permit any further Player changes. When a substitution has been made under the above rule, no additional substitution may be made until play commences. Once the line change procedure has been completed, no additional Player substitutions shall be permitted until the “face-off” has been completed legally and play has resumed, except when a penalty or penalties are imposed that affect the “on-ice strength” of either or both Teams. This may include penalties imposed following the completion of the line change and prior to the “face-off”, or due to a penalty assessed for a “face-off” violation – refer to Rule 82.2 – Line Change – Procedure. A Team that is in violation of {rule_reference_0} or {rule_reference_1} shall not be permitted to make any Player substitutions prior to the ensuing “face-off”. However, a Team shall be permitted to make a Player substitution to replace a Goalkeeper who had been substituted for an extra attacker, to replace an injured Player, or when a penalty has been assessed which affects the “on-ice strength” of either Team.

Goalkeepers’ substitution during a game will be conducted within the same time frame as a regular line change.
