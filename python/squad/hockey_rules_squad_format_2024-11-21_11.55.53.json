A Team shall be composed of twenty-two (22) Players. No more than twenty (20) Skaters and two (2) Goalkeepers shall be permitted. For the purposes of these playing rules, any reference to “Player” shall refer to both Skaters and Goalkeepers. Any reference to “Goalkeeper” shall mean that the section of the rule is specific to Goalkeepers. Prior to the start of each game, the Team Manager or Coach of each Team shall list on a “Line-up / Roster Sheet” the Players who are eligible to play in the game. For a Team to play a game, it must be able to put on the ice at least five (5) Skaters and one (1) Goalkeeper at the beginning of the game. Only eligible Players can be listed on the Roster Sheet and play in a Game. Players who are registered for a tournament or event but who are not listed on the Official Game Sheet can participate in the pre-game warm-up. The Coach must submit the “Line-up / Roster Sheet” to the Official Scorekeeper at least sixty (60) minutes prior to the start of the game. The Official Game Sheet with the listed names and numbers of all eligible Players must be handed to the On-ice Game Officials before the Game, and no change shall be permitted to the Official Game Sheet after the commencement of the Game. Prior to the Game, if an Official (on-ice or off-ice) notices that a Player is in uniform but has not been included on the Official Game Sheet, the Referee shall bring this to the attention of the offending Team so that the necessary correction can be made to the Official Game Sheet with no penalty assessed. At IIHF Championships, a representative from each Team must confirm the “Line-up / Roster Sheet” at least two (2) minutes prior to the start of the Game, and Players may be added or deleted up to the “opening face-off”. Game rules will not allow for a Team to have more than six (6) Players (one (1) Goalkeeper and five (5) Skaters) on the ice at any time during game action when the team is not penalized. (Rule 74 – Too Many Players on the Ice) A Team must put at least four (4) Players (one (1) Goalkeeper and three (3) Skaters) on the ice, if two (2) or more Players are penalized. A Team must put the required number of players on the ice to resume play. (Rule 66 – Forfeit of Game) ( » For more information refer to IIHF Sport Guideline and IIHF Event Codes.)",

During the play, if an injured Player wishes to retire from the ice and be replaced by a substitute, they must do so at the Players’ Bench and not through any other exit leading from the Rink. This is not a legal Player change and therefore when a violation occurs, a Bench-minor Penalty shall be imposed. If a penalized Player has been injured, they may proceed to the Dressing Room without taking a seat in the Penalty Box. The penalized Team shall immediately put a substitute Player in the Penalty Box, who shall serve the penalty until the injured Player is able to return to the game. They would replace their Teammate in the Penalty Box at the next stoppage of play. For violation of this rule, a Bench Minor Penalty shall be imposed. Should the injured penalized Player who has been replaced in the Penalty Box return to their Players’ Bench prior to the expiration of their penalty, they shall not be eligible to play until their penalty has expired. This includes coincidental penalties when their substitute is still in the Penalty Box awaiting a stoppage in play. The injured Player must wait until their substitute has been released from the Penalty Box before they are eligible to play. If, however, there is a stoppage of play prior to the expiration of their penalty, they must then replace their Teammate in the Penalty Box and is then eligible to return once their penalty has expired. When a Player is injured so that they cannot continue play or go to their Players’ Bench, the play shall not be stopped until the injured Player’s Team has secured control of the puck. If the Player’s Team is in “control of the puck” at the time of injury, play shall be stopped immediately unless their Team is in a scoring position. In the case where it is obvious that a Player has sustained a serious injury, the Referee and/or Linesperson may stop the play immediately. Where an injury has occurred to a Player and there is a stoppage of play, a Team Doctor (or other Medical Personnel) may go onto the ice to attend to the injured Player without waiting for the Referee’s consent. When play has been stopped by the Referee or Linesperson due to an injured Player, or whenever an injured Player is attended to on the ice by the Coach or Medical Personnel, such Player must be substituted for immediately. This injured Player cannot return to the ice until play has resumed. When play is stopped for an injured Player, the ensuing “face-off” shall be conducted at the Face-off Spot in the zone nearest the location of the puck when the play was stopped. When the injured Player’s Team has control of the puck in the Attacking Zone, the “face-off” shall be conducted at the nearest Faceoff Spot in the Neutral Zone. When the injured Player is in their Defending Zone and the attacking Team is in “possession of the puck” in the Attacking Zone, the “face-off” shall be conducted at the nearest Face-off Spot in the defending Team’s zone. A player who lies on the ice either feigning an injury or refusing to get up off the ice will be issued a Minor Penalty.",

When a formal complaint is made by the Captain or Alternate Captain of a Team, against the dimensions of an opponent’s stick, that opponent must be on the ice at the time the request is made to the Referee. It must be specified which part of the stick should be measured. Once the request is made, and as long as the On-ice Officials maintain visual contact with the stick, it can be measured. This means that if the Player whose stick is about to be measured steps off the ice onto their Players’ Bench, their stick may still be measured provided the request was received prior to them leaving the ice surface and the stick remains in the view of at least one of the On-ice Officials. The Referee shall take the stick to the Penalty Box where the necessary measurement shall be made immediately. Players on both Teams shall retire to their respective Players Benches. To measure the curvature of the blade of the stick, the Referee must draw an imaginary line along the outside of the shaft to the bottom of the blade and then along the bottom of the blade – this will determine the location of the heel. Using an IIHF-approved measuring gauge, the Referee shall secure the gauge at the heel of the stick and measure the curvature of the blade from the heel to any point along the toe of the blade. To measure any other dimension of the stick, the Referee shall use a measuring tape. The result shall be reported to the Penalty Timekeeper, who shall record it on the Penalty Record form. The Referee will convey the result of the measurement to the Captain or Alternate Captain of the Team whose stick was measured. A Player whose stick has been measured and it is found not to conform to the rule shall be assessed a Minor Penalty and the stick will be returned to the Players’ Bench by the Referee. If the complaint is not sustained, a Bench Minor Penalty shall be imposed against the complaining Team. A Player who participates in the play (i.e., checks or prevents the movement of an opponent or who plays the puck) while carrying two sticks (including while taking a replacement stick to their Goalkeeper) shall incur a Minor Penalty under this rule. A request for a stick measurement in regular playing time is permitted, including after the scoring of a goal. However, a goal cannot be disallowed as a result of the measurement. A request for a stick measurement following a goal in Overtime (including one scored on a “Penalty Shot” in Overtime) is not permitted. Stick measurements prior to or during the shootout are permitted, subject to the guidelines outlined in (Rule 10.7. – Stick Measurement – Prior to Shootout Attempt) Any Player who deliberately breaks their stick or who refuses to surrender their stick for measurement when requested to do so by the Referee shall be assessed a Minor Penalty plus a ten-minute (10) Misconduct Penalty.",

A Player whose stick has been measured and it is found not to conform to the rule shall be assessed a Minor Penalty and the stick will be returned to the Players’ Bench by the Referee.

A request for a stick measurement in regular playing time is permitted, including after the scoring of a goal. However, a goal cannot be disallowed as a result of the measurement. A request for a stick measurement following a goal in Overtime (including one scored on a “Penalty Shot” in Overtime) is not permitted.

When the Minor Penalties of two Players of the same Team terminate at the same time, the Captain of that Team shall designate to the Referee which of such Players will return to the ice first and the Referee will instruct the Penalty Timekeeper accordingly.",

Should a Goalkeeper commit a second (2nd) violation and the “Penalty Shot” fails, they shall be assessed a Misconduct Penalty and the Referee shall permit the “Penalty Shot” to be taken over again. A third (3rd) such violation shall result in the Goalkeeper being assessed a Game Misconduct Penalty and a goal shall be awarded. When a Major Penalty is committed by the Goalkeeper that causes the shot to fail, the Referee shall permit the “Penalty Shot” to be taken over again and the appropriate penalties shall be assessed to the Goalkeeper. The Goalkeeper may attempt to stop the “Penalty Shot” in any manner except by throwing their stick or any object, deliberately removes their helmet and/or face mask, or by deliberately dislodging the goal, in which case a goal shall be awarded. During the “Penalty Shot”, should the Goalkeeper, in an attempt at making a save, dislodge the goal accidentally, the Referee shall make one of the following determinations: (I) Award a goal if they deem the Player would have scored into the area normally occupied by the net had it not been dislodged. (II) Allow the “Penalty Shot” to be re-taken if they do not score or it could not be determined if the puck would have entered the area normally occupied by the net. (III) If the goal becomes dislodged after the puck has crossed the Goal Line thus ending the “Penalty Shot”, the above determinations do not apply, the “Penalty Shot” is complete. If, while a “Penalty Shot” is being taken, any Player, Coach or team personnel of the opposing Team interferes with or distracts the Player taking the “Penalty Shot” and, because of such action, the “Penalty Shot” fails, a second (2nd) attempt shall be permitted. The Referee shall impose a Bench Minor Penalty to the offending Team, and if a Player on the Bench is responsible, a Misconduct Penalty on the Player responsible shall be assessed. When a Coach or team personnel is guilty of such an act, a Game Misconduct Penalty shall be assessed on the responsible person and the matter will be reported to the Proper Authorities for possible further disciplinary action. If, while the “Penalty Shot” is being taken, any Player, Coach or team personnel of the Team taking the “Penalty Shot” interferes with or distracts the Goalkeeper defending the “Penalty Shot” and, because of such action, the shot is successful, the Referee shall rule no goal and shall impose a Bench Minor Penalty to the offending Team. If while the “Penalty Shot” is being taken a spectator throws any object onto the ice that in the judgment of the Referee interferes with the Player taking the “Penalty Shot” or the Goalkeeper defending the “Penalty Shot”, they shall permit the “Penalty Shot” to be taken again.

If there are unusual delays for any reason, (e.g., altercation, arena installations, ice, or ice resurfacing problems) it is important to use discretion in starting the clock. To notify the teams that it is time to return to the ice surface at the beginning of each period, the official game timekeeper will sound a buzzer in the dressing room area to inform the teams using the following systems at each ice hall: a) Three (3) minutes remaining on the game clock-One (1) blast of the alarm by the official game timekeeper indicating that in one minute the teams will be called to the ice surface. b) Two (2) minutes remaining on the game clock-Two (2) blasts of the alarm by the official game timekeeper calling for the home team to immediately leave their dressing room and return to the ice surface. The away team immediately follows the last player of the home team to the ice surface. The Host has the option to propose amendments to this timing to ensure that the players are on the ice to start the period at the correct time.

If the review reveals that the goal should be counted, the clock (including penalty time clocks, if applicable) shall be reset to the time the goal was scored. If the review reveals that no goal was scored, no adjustment to the time clock(s) will be made. Only one goal can be awarded at any stoppage of play. If  an  apparent goal was scored by Team A and is subsequently confirmed as a goal by Video Review,  any goal scored by Team B during the period of time between the apparent goal by Team A and the stoppage of play (Team B’s goal), the Team B goal will not be awarded. If the apparent goal by Team A is deemed to have entered the goal illegally (e.g., a “distinct kicking motion”), the goal will be disallowed. No goal will be awarded to Team B either in this circumstance since the play should have been stopped at the time of the apparent goal. The clock (including penalty time clocks, if applicable) shall be reset to the time of Team A’s apparent goal – whether awarded or disallowed. Any penalties signaled during the period of time between the apparent goal and the next stoppage of play shall be assessed in the normal manner, except when a Minor Penalty is to be assessed to the Team scored upon and is therefore nullified by the scoring of the goal – refer to (Rule 16.2. – Minor Penalties) (Rule 18.2. – Double-minor Penalties) If an infraction happens after the first stoppage of play following an apparent goal (infraction after the whistle) by either Team, it is assessed and served in the normal manner regardless as to the decision rendered by Video Review. When the Referee indicates there is a Video Review in progress, all Players (with the exception of the Goalkeepers) should proceed to their respective Players’ Bench immediately, and failure to do so may result in a Game Misconduct Penalty for offending Player(s) and shall be reported to the Proper Authorities. Any potential goal requiring Video Review must be reviewed prior to and/or during the next stoppage of play. No goal may be awarded (or disallowed) as a result of a Video Review once the play has resumed. The Video Review Consultant will connect directly with the Referee(s) at ice level to assist with the review of any close play or disputed goal. The On-ice Officials (Referees or Linespersons) decision shall be final. ( » For more information refer to IIHF Technology Codes & Regulations.)",

Failure to provide this information with reasonable specificity may result in the denial of a right to a Coach’s Challenge. Only one Coach’s Challenge per Team per stoppage will be permitted.",

The appropriate penalty should be assessed in every case where an opposing Player makes unnecessary contact with a Goalkeeper.

                    "context": "A Player who obstructs or prevents an opponent “without possession of the puck” from skating, receiving a pass, or moving about the ice freely is considered as “interference”. A “late-hit” constitutes reckless endangerment of a Player who “no longer has control or possession of the puck”. Any Player who is in the process of “abandoning” or “losing control or possession of the puck” is subject to a bodycheck so long as the aggressor is in the immediate vicinity of the Skater with the puck. A strict standard on acts of interference must be adhered to in all areas of the Rink. Body Position: “Body position” shall be determined as the Player skating in front of or beside their opponent, traveling in the same direction. A Player who is behind an opponent, who does not have the puck, may not use their stick, body, or free hand in order to restrain their opponent, but must skate in order to gain or reestablish their “proper position” in order to make a check. A Player is allowed the ice they are standing on (body position) and are not required to move in order to let an opponent proceed. A Player may “block the path” of an opponent provided they are in front of their opponent and moving in the same direction. Moving laterally and without “establishing body position”, then making contact with the non-puck carrier is not permitted and will be penalized as “interference”. A Player is always entitled to use their “body position” to lengthen an opponent’s path to the puck, provided their stick is not utilized (to make themself “bigger” and therefore considerably lengthening the distance their opponent must travel to get where they are going); their “free hand” is not used, and they do not take advantage of their “body position” to deliver an otherwise illegal check. Possession of the Puck: The last Player to touch the puck, other than the Goalkeeper, shall be considered the Player in “possession”. The Player deemed in “possession” of the puck may be checked legally, provided the check is rendered immediately following them “loss of control” and their opponent still finds themself within an “objectively reasonable window of opportunity” to deliver such a check refer to Rule 56.4 – Interference . Restrain: The actions of a Player who does not have “body position”, but instead uses illegal means (e.g., “hook” with stick; “hold” with hands, “trip” with the stick or in any manner) to impede an opponent who is not in “possession” of the puck. Illegal means are acts which allow a Player to “establish,  maintain or restore body position” other than by skating. Pick: A “pick” is the action of a Player who checks an opponent who is not in “possession” of the puck and is unaware of the impending check/hit. A Player who is aware of an impending hit, not deemed to be a legal “battle for the puck,” may not be interfered with by a Player delivering a “pick.” A Player delivering a “pick” is one who moves into an opponent’s path without initially having “body position”, thereby taking them “out of the play”. When this is done, an “interference” penalty shall be assessed. Free Hand: When a “free hand” is used to hold, pull, tug, grab or physically restrain an opponent from moving “freely”, this must be penalized as “holding”. The “free hand” may be used by a Player to “fend off” an opponent or their stick but may not be used to hold an opponent’s stick or body. Stick: A Player who does not have “body position” on their opponent, who uses their stick (either the blade or the shaft, including the butt-end of the shaft) to impede or prevent their opponent from moving “freely” on the ice shall be assessed a “hooking” penalty.

Possession of the Puck: The last Player to touch the puck, other than the Goalkeeper, shall be considered the Player in “possession”. The Player deemed in “possession” of the puck may be checked legally, provided the check is rendered immediately following them “loss of control” and their opponent still finds themself within an “objectively reasonable window of opportunity” to deliver such a check refer to Rule 56.4 – Interference . Restrain: The actions of a Player who does not have “body position”, but instead uses illegal means (e.g., “hook” with stick; “hold” with hands, “trip” with the stick or in any manner) to impede an opponent who is not in “possession” of the puck. Illegal means are acts which allow a Player to “establish,  maintain or restore body position” other than by skating. Pick: A “pick” is the action of a Player who checks an opponent who is not in “possession” of the puck and is unaware of the impending check/hit. A Player who is aware of an impending hit, not deemed to be a legal “battle for the puck,” may not be interfered with by a Player delivering a “pick.” A Player delivering a “pick” is one who moves into an opponent’s path without initially having “body position”, thereby taking them “out of the play”. When this is done, an “interference” penalty shall be assessed. Free Hand: When a “free hand” is used to hold, pull, tug, grab or physically restrain an opponent from moving “freely”, this must be penalized as “holding”. The “free hand” may be used by a Player to “fend off” an opponent or their stick but may not be used to hold an opponent’s stick or body. Stick: A Player who does not have “body position” on their opponent, who uses their stick (either the blade or the shaft, including the butt-end of the shaft) to impede or prevent their opponent from moving “freely” on the ice shall be assessed a “hooking” penalty.

The determining factor shall be the position of the puck when it was shot or batted by the offending Player. If contact with the puck occurs while the puck is inside the Defending Zone, and subsequently goes out of play, the Minor Penalty shall be assessed. When the puck is shot over the Protective Glass surrounding the Players’ Bench, the penalty will be assessed. Note: When the puck is shot into the Players’ Bench, the penalty will not apply. When the puck goes out of the playing area directly off a “face-off”, no penalty shall be assessed; (IV) On any Player who delays the game by deliberately displacing a Goal Post from its normal position.

Note: If a Player deliberately displaces a Goal Post from its normal position when an opponent has an imminent scoring opportunity on an open net, a goal may be awarded by the Referee (Rule 63.7 – Awarded Goal) (V) On a Player other than the Goalkeeper who deliberately falls on or gathers the puck into their body; Note: Any Player who drops to their knees to block a shot should not be penalized if the puck is shot under them or becomes lodged in their clothing or equipment but any use of the hands to make the puck unplayable should be penalized promptly; (VI) On a Goalkeeper who “races out” of their Goal Crease in an attempt to beat the attacking Player to the puck and instead of playing the puck jumps on the puck causing a stoppage of play; Note: If a Goalkeeper comes out of their Goal Crease to “cut down the angle” on a shot and after making the save covers the puck, this shall be legal. (VII) On a Goalkeeper who, when they are in their own Goal Crease, deliberately falls on or gathers the puck into their body or who holds or places the puck against any part of the goal in such a manner as to cause a stoppage of play unless they are actually being checked by an opponent; (VIII) On a Goalkeeper who plays the puck outside of the Designated Area behind the net. The determining factor shall be the position of the puck. Note: The Minor Penalty will not be assessed when a Goalkeeper plays the puck while maintaining skate contact with the Goal Crease. (IX) For adjustments to clothing, equipment, skates, or sticks. Note: No penalty should be assessed when a water bottle is delivered to a Goalkeeper, however, this should be conducted during time-outs and if, in the opinion of the Referee, it is being done to intentionally delay the game, a Minor Penalty may be assessed.

Regarding to a Goalkeeper, this rule applies outside of their Goal Crease area; (II) On any Player who deliberately shoots or bats (using their hand or stick) the puck outside the playing area (from anywhere on the ice surface) during the play or after a stoppage of play; (III) On any Player who shoots or bats (using their hand or stick) the puck directly (non-deflected) out of the playing surface from their Defending Zone, except where there is no Protective Glass. The determining factor shall be the position of the puck when it was shot or batted by the offending Player. If contact with the puck occurs while the puck is inside the Defending Zone, and subsequently goes out of play, the Minor Penalty shall be assessed. When the puck is shot over the Protective Glass surrounding the Players’ Bench, the penalty will be assessed. Note: When the puck is shot into the Players’ Bench, the penalty will not apply. When the puck goes out of the playing area directly off a “face-off”, no penalty shall be assessed; (IV) On any Player who delays the game by deliberately displacing a Goal Post from its normal position. The Referee shall stop play immediately when the offending Team gains “control” of the puck. Note: If a Player deliberately displaces a Goal Post from its normal position when an opponent has an imminent scoring opportunity on an open net, a goal may be awarded by the Referee (Rule 63.7 – Awarded Goal) (V) On a Player other than the Goalkeeper who deliberately falls on or gathers the puck into their body; Note: Any Player who drops to their knees to block a shot should not be penalized if the puck is shot under them or becomes lodged in their clothing or equipment but any use of the hands to make the puck unplayable should be penalized promptly; (VI) On a Goalkeeper who “races out” of their Goal Crease in an attempt to beat the attacking Player to the puck and instead of playing the puck jumps on the puck causing a stoppage of play; Note: If a Goalkeeper comes out of their Goal Crease to “cut down the angle” on a shot and after making the save covers the puck, this shall be legal. (VII) On a Goalkeeper who, when they are in their own Goal Crease, deliberately falls on or gathers the puck into their body or who holds or places the puck against any part of the goal in such a manner as to cause a stoppage of play unless they are actually being checked by an opponent; (VIII) On a Goalkeeper who plays the puck outside of the Designated Area behind the net. The determining factor shall be the position of the puck. Note: The Minor Penalty will not be assessed when a Goalkeeper plays the puck while maintaining skate contact with the Goal Crease. (IX) For adjustments to clothing, equipment, skates, or sticks. Note: No penalty should be assessed when a water bottle is delivered to a Goalkeeper, however, this should be conducted during time-outs and if, in the opinion of the Referee, it is being done to intentionally delay the game, a Minor Penalty may be assessed. (X) No delay shall be permitted for the repair or adjustment of Goalkeeper’s equipment. If adjustments are required, the Goalkeeper shall leave the ice and their place shall be taken by the substitute Goalkeeper immediately. For an infraction of this rule by a Goalkeeper, a Minor Penalty shall be imposed.",

A Player serving a penalty in the Penalty Box, who is to be changed after the penalty has been served, must proceed at once by way of the ice and be at their own Players’ Bench before any change can be made.For any violation of this rule, a Bench Minor Penalty shall be imposed for “too many Players on the ice”. (Rule 74 – Too many Players on the Ice) A penalized Player who leaves the Penalty Box before their penalty has expired, whether play is in progress or not, shall incur an additional Minor Penalty after serving their unexpired penalty. Any Player who, having entered the Penalty Box, leaves the Penalty Box prior to the expiration of their penalty for the purpose of challenging an Official’s ruling, shall be assessed a Game Misconduct Penalty. If deemed appropriate, Supplementary Discipline can be applied by the Proper Authorities at their discretion. This rule does not replace any other more severe penalty that may be imposed for leaving the Penalty Box for the purpose of starting or participating in an altercation as outlined in this rule. (Rule 28 – Supplementary Discipline) Any penalized Player leaving the Penalty Box during a stoppage of play and during an altercation shall incur a Minor Penalty plus a Game Misconduct Penalty. The Minor Penalty plus the unexpired time remaining in their original penalty must be served by a replacement Player placed in the Penalty Box by the Coach of the offending Team. If a Player leaves the Penalty Box before their penalty is fully served, the Penalty Timekeeper shall note the time and signal the On-ice Officials who will stop play when the offending Player’s Team obtains “control of the puck”.

If a Player's skate crosses the line into the Face-off Circle prior to the drop of the puck, this shall be deemed as a “face-off” violation. A Player's stick may be inside the Face-off Circle provided there is no physical contact with their opponent or their opponent's stick. (II) Encroachment by any Player into the area between the hash marks on the outer edges of the Face-off Circle prior to the puck being dropped. Players must also ensure that both of their skates do not cross their respective hash marks. Contact with the line with their skate is permitted. If a Player's skate crosses the line into the area between the hash marks prior to the drop of the puck, this shall be deemed as a “face-off” violation. A Player's stick may be inside the area between the hash marks provided there is no physical contact with their opponent or their opponent's stick. (III) Any physical contact with an opponent prior to the puck being dropped. If either Player taking the “face-off” makes helmet-to-helmet contact with their opponent, they must receive a first “face-off” violation warning. If the Linesperson cannot differentiate which Player initiated the contact, both Players must receive a first “face-off” violation warning. (IV) Failure by either center taking the “face-off” to “properly position themself behind the restraining lines” or place their stick on the ice – as outlined in Rule 76.4 – Face-off Procedure – Centers. \"Properly position themself behind the restraining lines\" shall mean that the center must place their feet on either side of the restraining lines that are parallel to the side Boards (contact with the lines is permissible), and the toe of the blade of their skates must not cross over the restraining lines that are perpendicular to the side Boards as they approach the Face-off Spot. The blade of the stick must then be placed on the ice, at least the toe of the blade of the stick, in the designated white area of the Face-off Spot and must remain there until the puck is dropped. (V) Failure to comply with this positioning and “face-off” procedure will result in a “face-off” violation. Whenever a Team has committed two (2) “face-off” violations during the same “face-off”, the Referee shall immediately assess the offending Team a Bench Minor Penalty for “Delay of Game”. This penalty shall be announced as a Bench Minor Penalty for Delay of Game – Face-off Violation. Players who are late to the “face-off” location and therefore in an off-side position for the ensuing “face-off” will be warned once in the game by the Referee. This warning will also be given to the offending Team’s Coach. In this situation, the offending Team’s center will not receive a warning for a “face-off” violation. Any subsequent violation shall result in a Bench Minor Penalty for “Delay of Game” being assessed to the offending Team. This penalty shall be announced as a “Bench Minor Penalty for “Delay of Game” – Slow Proceeding to Face-off Location. In the conduct of any “face-off” at any of the nine (9) Face-off Spots on the playing surface, no Player facing-off shall make any physical contact with their opponent’s body by means of their own body or by their stick except in the course of playing the puck after the “face-off” has been completed. For violation of this rule, the Referee may, at their discretion impose a Minor Penalty or penalties on the Player(s) whose action(s) caused the “physical contact”. Nonetheless, this “physical contact” prior to the dropping of the puck shall be deemed as a “face-off” violation and the center will be warned by the Linesperson that the Team has committed a “face-off” violation and any subsequent violation will result in a Bench Minor Penalty for “Delay of Game” – “face-off” violation being assessed. “Face-off” encroachment may be applied during “face-offs” at any of the nine (9) Face-off Spots on the playing surface However, since no such lines are painted on the ice at the four (4) Face-off Spots adjacent to the Blue Lines, Linespersons shall use their judgment as to whether or not a violation has occurred. All Players, other than the centers, shall be uniformly back from the “face-off” location similar to being outside the Face-off Circle for “face-offs” in the End Zones.",

The Home Team may then make any desired substitution, except in cases following an “icing”, which does not result in the delay of the game. “Placing a line-up on the ice” shall mean that both Teams shall place the full complement of Players (and not exceed) to which they are entitled within the line change time frame. If there is any undue delay by either Team in changing Players, the Referee shall order the offending Team or Teams to take their positions immediately and not permit any further Player changes. When a substitution has been made under the above rule, no additional substitution may be made until play commences. Once the line change procedure has been completed, no additional Player substitutions shall be permitted until the “face-off” has been completed legally and play has resumed, except when a penalty or penalties are imposed that affect the “on-ice strength” of either or both Teams. This may include penalties imposed following the completion of the line change and prior to the “face-off”, or due to a penalty assessed for a “face-off” violation – refer to Rule 82.2 – Line Change – Procedure. A Team that is in violation of (Rule 63.8 – Delaying the Game) or (Rule 81 – Icing) shall not be permitted to make any Player substitutions prior to the ensuing “face-off”. However, a Team shall be permitted to make a Player substitution to replace a Goalkeeper who had been substituted for an extra attacker, to replace an injured Player, or when a penalty has been assessed which affects the “on-ice strength” of either Team. The determination of Players on ice will be made when the puck leaves the offending Player’s stick. Goalkeepers’ substitution during a game will be conducted within the same time frame as a regular line change. No extra time will be allotted to the Goalkeeper coming off the bench, except in the case where an injury to a Goalkeeper occurs.",

The “face-off” will be conducted at the Face-off Spot in the zone closest to the point of origin of the shot that gives the offending Team the least amount of “territorial advantage”. The only way an attacking Team can score a goal on a “Delayed Off-side” situation is if the defending Team shoots or puts the puck into their own net without action or contact by the offending Team. Other than in situations involving a “Delayed Off-side” and the puck entering the goal or a successful Coach’s Challenge, no goal can be disallowed after the fact for an “off-side” violation, except for the human factor involved in blowing the whistle.
